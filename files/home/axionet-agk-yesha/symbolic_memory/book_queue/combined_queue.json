{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_228","context":"in little that either side could justly assert to be a success."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_229","context":"The rigors inevitable in such a mode of warfare had become almost"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_230","context":"beyond human endurance, and commanders on both sides looked forward"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_231","context":"to a more active campaign."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_233","context":"An immense amount of ammunition had been stored by the French in"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_234","context":"and around Perthes in anticipation of a forward movement; and, by"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_235","context":"the second week of February, a quarter of a million men of the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_236","context":"French army had been assembled near that place. They were opposite"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_237","context":"a section of the German trenches which was about twelve miles long,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_238","context":"extending from Ville-sur-Tourbe in the Argonne to the village of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_239","context":"Souain. Early in the year this section had been held by only two"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_240","context":"divisions of Rhinelanders. These two divisions had suffered severely"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_241","context":"from the heavy gun fire which the French had directed against them"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_242","context":"by means of the successful work of the French aviators. The French"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_243","context":"infantry also had done effective work in the short rush which they"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_244","context":"had been making, gaining on an average about twelve yards a day."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_245","context":"Following the concentration of French troops, the German commanders"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_246","context":"brought up reenforcements to the number of 80,000. Some of these"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_247","context":"were taken from La Bassée, and others from a contingent which had"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_248","context":"been intended for a northern offensive movement."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_250","context":"Because of the chalk formation of the soil in this section of the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_251","context":"front, the excessive moisture of this season of the year drained"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_252","context":"rapidly, leaving exposed an undulating section on which were small"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_253","context":"forests of fir trees. The nature of the ground made it an easy"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_254","context":"matter to move troops even in winter. General Joffre took advantage"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_255","context":"of this fact, and assembled a quarter of a million men against the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_256","context":"German lines in Champagne. This caused the German commanders to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_257","context":"mass troops just in front of Perthes. The concentration continued"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_258","context":"until there were 220,000 German soldiers packed there in close"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_259","context":"formation. The French attacked, and quickly a rain of more than"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_260","context":"a hundred thousand shells fell upon the Germans."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_262","context":"The Germans sought to reply by bringing up twenty-two batteries of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_263","context":"heavy guns and sixty-four field batteries; but the French gunners"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_264","context":"kept command of the field. In the twenty days' battle--from February"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_265","context":"16 to March 7, 1915--the French won scarcely a mile of ground;"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_266","context":"but they found and buried 10,000 German dead. The French staff"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_267","context":"estimated that 60,000 German soldiers had been put out of action."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_268","context":"The German staff admitted they had lost more men in this action"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_269","context":"than in the campaign in East Prussia against the Russians, where"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_270","context":"fourteen German army corps were engaged. The French lost less than"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_271","context":"10,000 men."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_273","context":"In the last week of February, 1915, it had been learned by General"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_274","context":"Joffre that General von Falkenhayn of the German forces had withdrawn"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_275","context":"from Neuve Chapelle, and the section north of La Bassée six batteries"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_276","context":"of field artillery, six battalions of the Prussian Guard, and two"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_277","context":"heavy batteries of the Prussian Guard. These had been withdrawn for"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_278","context":"the purpose of checking the supposed French advance at Perthes, as"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_279","context":"already narrated. Hence, it was known that the English, in command"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_280","context":"of Sir Douglas Haig, at Neuve Chapelle, were opposed by a thin line"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_281","context":"of German troops who were making a demonstration of force for the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_282","context":"purpose of concealing the weakness of their line."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_284","context":"[Illustration: THE WESTERN BATTLE LINE, JANUARY 1, 1915]"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_286","context":"The British officers in the region of Neuve Chapelle received complete"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_287","context":"instructions on March 8, 1915, in regard to an offensive which they"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_288","context":"were to start on the 10th. These instructions were supplemental to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_289","context":"a communication which had been sent on February 19 by the British"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_290","context":"commander in chief to Sir Douglas Haig, the commander of the First"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_291","context":"Army. Neuve Chapelle was to be the immediate objective of the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_292","context":"prospective engagement. This place is about four miles north of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_293","context":"La Bassée at the junction of main roads, one leading southward"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_294","context":"to La Bassée, and another from Bethune on the west to Armentieres"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_295","context":"on the northeast. It is about eleven miles west of Lille. These"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_296","context":"roads formed an irregular diamond-shaped figure with the village"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_297","context":"at the apex of the eastern sides, along which the German troops"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_298","context":"were stationed. The British held the western sides of this figure."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_300","context":"The land in this part of France is marshy and crossed by dykes;"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_301","context":"but, to the eastward, the ground rises slowly to a ridge, on the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_302","context":"western border of which are two spurs. Aubers is at the apex of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_303","context":"one; and Illies at the apex of the other. Both of these villages"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_304","context":"were held by the Germans. The ridge extends northeast, beyond the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_305","context":"junction of the spurs, from Fournes to within two miles southwest of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_306","context":"Lille. Along the ridge is the road to Lille, Roubaix, and Tourcoing,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_307","context":"all of which are among the chief manufacturing towns of France."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_308","context":"The occupation of the ridge was a necessary step to the taking"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_309","context":"of Lille; and Neuve Chapelle was at the gateway to the ridge. If"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_310","context":"the Allies could take Lille they would then be in a position to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_311","context":"move against their enemy between that point and the sea."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_313","context":"The River Des Layes runs behind Neuve Chapelle to the southeast;"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_314","context":"and, behind the river, a half mile from the straggling village,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_315","context":"is a wood known as the Bois du Biez. Almost at right angles to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_316","context":"the river, on the west, the main road from Estaires to La Bassée"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_317","context":"skirts Neuve Chapelle. There is a triangle of roads north of the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_318","context":"village where there were a few large houses with walls, gardens,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_319","context":"and orchards. At this point the Germans had fortified themselves"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_320","context":"to flank the approaches to the village from that section. These"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_321","context":"trenches were only about a hundred yards from those of the British."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_322","context":"The Germans had machine guns at a bridge over the river; and they"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_323","context":"had another post established a little farther up at the Pietre"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_324","context":"mill. Farther down the stream, where the road into the village"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_325","context":"joins the main road to La Bassée, the Germans had fortified a group"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_326","context":"of ruined buildings which was known as Port Arthur. From there was"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_327","context":"a great network of trenches which extended northwestward to the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_328","context":"Pietre mill. There were also German troops in the Bois du Biez,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_329","context":"and in the ruined houses along the border of the wood."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_331","context":"[Illustration: RUSSIAN-GERMAN FRONTIER, POLAND AND THE BALTIC PROVINCES]"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_333","context":"The German trenches were in excellent positions, but were occupied"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_334","context":"by only a comparatively few soldiers; it was the German plan to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_335","context":"keep large bodies of troops in reserve, so that they might be sent"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_336","context":"to any sector where the need seemed most likely. They have asserted"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_337","context":"they had only four battalions in the front line here; but that"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_338","context":"statement is denied by the British."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_340","context":"The British plan of attack embraced a heavy bombardment to demoralize"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_341","context":"their enemy and prevent reenforcement. This was to be followed"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_342","context":"by an infantry attack. It was expected that the Germans would be"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_343","context":"surprised to such an extent it would be impossible for them to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_344","context":"make much resistance. Units of the First Army were to make the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_345","context":"main attack, supported by the Second Army. The support included"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_357","context":"Three hundred and fifty guns at short range began a most terrific"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_358","context":"bombardment March 10, 1915, at 7.30 a. m. It is said that the discharges"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_359","context":"of the artillery was so frequent that it seemed as if some gigantic"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_360","context":"machine gun was in action. Shortly after this bombardment started,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_361","context":"the German trenches were covered by a great cloud of smoke and"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_362","context":"dust and a pall of green lyddite fumes. The first line of German"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_363","context":"trenches, against which the fire was directed, became great shapeless"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_364","context":"furrows and craters filled with the dead and dying."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_366","context":"This was the condition all along the line except on the extreme"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_367","context":"northern end where the artillery fire was less effective, owing,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_368","context":"it was said, to a lack of proper preparation by the British staff."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_369","context":"This terrific artillery fire was continued for thirty-five minutes;"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_370","context":"and then the range was changed from the first line of German trenches"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_371","context":"to the village of Neuve Chapelle itself. Thereupon the British"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_372","context":"infantry advanced and made prisoners of the few Germans left alive"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_373","context":"in the first line. The men found unwounded were so dazed by the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_374","context":"onslaught which the guns had made upon their position that they"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_375","context":"offered no resistance. The bombardment had swept away the wire"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_376","context":"entanglements; and the British had only the greasy mud with which"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_377","context":"to contend, when they made their dash forward."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_379","context":"Where the wire entanglements had been swept away, the Second"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_380","context":"Lincolnshire and the Berkshire regiments were the first to reach"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_381","context":"the German trenches. These regiments then turned to the right and"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_382","context":"left, and thus permitted the Royal Irish Rifles and the Rifle Brigade"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_383","context":"to go on toward the village."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_385","context":"In order to understand the infantry attack in detail it is necessary"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_386","context":"to know the manner in which the British troops were distributed"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_387","context":"before they made their dash at the ruined trenches of the Germans."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_388","context":"Two brigades of the Eighth Division, the Twenty-fifth to the right"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_389","context":"and the Twenty-third to the left, were due west of Neuve Chapelle."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_390","context":"On a front a mile and a half long to the south of them was the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_391","context":"Meerut Division, supported by the Lahore Division. The Garhwal"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_392","context":"Brigade was on the left and the Dehra Dun Brigade was on its right."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_393","context":"In the first attack the Twenty-third dashed to the northeast corner"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_394","context":"of the village, the Twenty-fifth against the village itself; and"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_395","context":"the Garhwal Brigade charged on the southwest corner."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_397","context":"The trenches opposite the Twenty-fifth were taken with practically"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_398","context":"no fighting. The Germans who had manned them were either killed"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_399","context":"or too dazed to offer resistance. As has already been told, the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_400","context":"Second Royal Berkshires and the Second Lincolns took the first line"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_401","context":"of trenches in front of them, and opened the middle of their line"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_402","context":"to permit the Second Rifle Brigade and the First Irish Rifles to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_403","context":"dash on to the village. The British artillery range was lengthened,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_404","context":"thereby preventing the German supports from interference with the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_405","context":"well-defined plan of the British. Into the wrecked streets of Neuve"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_406","context":"Chapelle swung two battalions of the Twenty-fifth Brigade. The few"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_407","context":"of their enemy who offered resistance were soon overpowered--being"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_408","context":"captured or slain."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_410","context":"These men of the Twenty-fifth Brigade found terrible scenes of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_411","context":"destruction. The village had been knocked literally into a rubbish"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_412","context":"heap. Even the dead in the village churchyard had been plowed from"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_413","context":"their graves by the terrific bombardment."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_415","context":"The Garhwal Brigade captured the first line of trenches on the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_416","context":"right, and the Third Gurkhas, on the southern outskirts of the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_417","context":"village, met the Rifle Brigade. Then it dashed on to the Bois du"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_418","context":"Biez, passing another rubbish heap which once had been the hamlet"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_419","context":"known as Port Arthur."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_421","context":"The attack on the left, however, resulted less successfully for"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_422","context":"the British forces. As indicated above, the preparation for the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_423","context":"bombardment at this part of the line had been inadequate for the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_424","context":"purpose which the general in command had sought to achieve. Thus"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_425","context":"on the northeast corner of Neuve Chapelle the German trenches and"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_426","context":"the wire entanglements in front of them had been damaged but little."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_427","context":"The British forces on this part of the line included the Second"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_428","context":"Devons, the Second West Yorks, the Second Scottish Rifles, and the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_429","context":"Second Middlesex, known as the Twenty-third Brigade. The Scottish"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_430","context":"Rifles charged against intact wire entanglements which halted them"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_431","context":"in the range of a murderous rifle and machine-gun fire. With daring"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_432","context":"bravery the Scots sought to tear down the wire with their hands;"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_433","context":"but were forced to fall back and lie in the fire-swept zone until"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_434","context":"one company forced its way through an opening and destroyed the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_435","context":"barrier. The regiment, as a result of this mishap to the plans"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_436","context":"of the commanding general, lost its commander, Colonel Bliss, and"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_437","context":"fourteen other officers."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_439","context":"The Middlesex, on the right, met with the same obstruction and lost"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_440","context":"many of its men and officers while waiting for the British artillery"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_441","context":"to smash a way through for them. This the artillery did when word"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_442","context":"had been carried back telling of the plight of the infantry."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_444","context":"The Twenty-fifth Brigade, to the south, had the good fortune to turn"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_445","context":"the flank of the Germans north of Neuve Chapelle. Then the entire"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_446","context":"Twenty-third Brigade forced its way to the orchard northeast of the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_447","context":"village, where it met the Twenty-fourth Brigade, which included the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_448","context":"First Worcesters, Second East Lancashires, First Sherwood Foresters,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_449","context":"and the Second Northamptons. The Twenty-fourth Brigade had fought its"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_450","context":"way through from the Neuve Chapelle-Armentières road. As soon as"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_451","context":"this had been accomplished by the British, their artillery proceeded"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_452","context":"to send such a rain of shrapnel fire between the village and the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_453","context":"Germans that a counterattack was quite impossible. This gave the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_454","context":"victors an opportunity to intrench themselves practically at their"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_455","context":"leisure. The plans of the British commander had embraced a forward"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_456","context":"movement when the troops had reached this point, but they had not"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_457","context":"included a means of keeping communication with the various units"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_458","context":"intact. The telegraph and telephone wires had been cut by the shot"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_459","context":"and shell of both sides; and there was no opportunity to repair"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_460","context":"them until it was too late to take advantage of the demoralization"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_461","context":"of the Germans. Moreover, the delay of the Twenty-third Brigade had"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_462","context":"so disarranged the plans of the British that it is doubtful if they"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_463","context":"would not have failed in part even if the means of communication had"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_464","context":"not been destroyed. Nevertheless, Sir John French wrote: \"I am"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_465","context":"of the opinion that this delay would not have occurred had the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_466","context":"clearly expressed orders of the general officer commanding the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_467","context":"First Army been more carefully observed.\""}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_469","context":"There was also an additional delay in bringing up the reserves"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_470","context":"of the Fourth Corps. Thus it was not until 3.30 p. m. that three"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_471","context":"brigades of the Seventh Division, the Twentieth, Twenty-first,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_472","context":"and Twenty-second Brigades were in their places on the left of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_473","context":"the Twenty-fourth Brigade. Then the left moved southward toward"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_474","context":"Aubers. At the same time the Indian Corps, composed of the Garhwal"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_475","context":"Brigade and the Dehra Dun Brigade, forced its way through the Bois"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_476","context":"du Biez toward the ridge. Strong opposition was met with to such"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_477","context":"an extent, however, that the Thirty-ninth Garhwals and the Second"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_478","context":"Leicesters suffered severe losses on reaching a German position"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_479","context":"which had practically escaped the heavy artillery fire. A German"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_480","context":"outpost at the bridge held the Dehra Dun Brigade, which was supported"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_481","context":"by the Jullundur Brigade of the Lahore Division, in its attack"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_482","context":"farther to the south on the line of the River Des Layes. The First"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_483","context":"Brigade of the First Corps was rushed forward by Sir Douglas Haig;"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_484","context":"but it was dark before these troops arrived. Another fortified"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_485","context":"bridge, farther to the left, checked the Twenty-fifth Brigade;"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_486","context":"and machine-gun fire stopped the Twenty-fourth Brigade, this fire"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_487","context":"being from the German troops at the crossroads northwest of Pietre"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_488","context":"village. The Seventh Division was held by the line of the Des Layes,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_489","context":"and the defense of the Pietre mill."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_491","context":"By evening the British had gone forward as far as their artillery"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_492","context":"fire had been effective; and it was found necessary for them to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_493","context":"stop to strengthen the new line which they had established. They had"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_494","context":"won Neuve Chapelle. They had advanced a mile. They had straightened"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_495","context":"their line, but they could go no farther."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_497","context":"On the following day, March 11, 1915, the British artillery was"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_498","context":"directed against the Bois de Biez and the trenches in the neighborhood"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_499","context":"of Pietre. The Germans, however, had recovered from the surprise"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_500","context":"of the great bombardment, and they made several counterattacks."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_501","context":"Little progress was made on that day by either side. On that night,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_502","context":"March 11, the Bavarian and Saxon reserves arrived from Tourcoing,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_503","context":"and on the morning of March 12 the counterattack extended along the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_504","context":"British front. Because of the heavy mist, and the lack of proper"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_505","context":"communications, it was impossible for the British artillery to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_506","context":"do much damage. The defense of the bridges across the Des Layes"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_507","context":"kept the British forces from the ridges and the capture of Aubers."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_508","context":"The best that the British seemed to be able to do was to prevent"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_509","context":"the German counterattack from being successful."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_511","context":"An attempt to use the British cavalry was unsuccessful on March 12."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_512","context":"The Second Cavalry Division, in command of General Hubert Gough,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_513","context":"with a brigade of the North Midland Division, was ordered to support"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_514","context":"the infantry offensive, it being believed that the cavalry might"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_515","context":"penetrate the German lines. When the Fifth Cavalry Brigade, under"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_516","context":"command of Sir Philip Chetwode, arrived in the Rue Bacquerot at 4"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_517","context":"p. m., Sir Henry Rawlinson reported the German positions intact,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_518","context":"and the cavalry retired to Estaires."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_520","context":"[Illustration: THE BATTLE AT NEUVE CHAPELLE]"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_522","context":"The attack of the Seventh Division against the Pietre Fort continued"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_523","context":"all the day of March 12, as did the attempt to take the Des Layes"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_524","context":"bridges from the Germans, who were valiantly defending their second"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_525","context":"line of trenches in the Bois du Biez. Probably the fiercest fighting"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_526","context":"of that day fell to the lot of the Twentieth Brigade, composed of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_527","context":"the First Grenadiers, the Second Scots Guards, the Second Border"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_528","context":"Regiment, and the Second Gordons, with the Sixth Gordons, a Territorial"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_529","context":"battalion. This brigade fought valiantly around Pietre Mill. Position"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_530","context":"after position was taken by them, but their efforts could not remain"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_531","context":"effective without the aid of artillery, which was lacking. The Second"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_532","context":"Rifle Brigade carried a section of the German trenches farther south"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_533","context":"that afternoon, but an enfilading fire drove the British back to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_534","context":"their former position."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_536","context":"It was evident by the night of March 12 that the British could not"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_537","context":"gain command of the ridge and that the Germans could not retake"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_538","context":"Neuve Chapelle. Hence Sir John French ordered Sir Douglas Haig"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_539","context":"to hold and consolidate the ground which had been taken by the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_540","context":"Fourth and Indian Corps, and suspend further offensive operations"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_541","context":"for the present. In his report General French set forth that the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_542","context":"three days' fighting had cost the British 190 officers and 2,337"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_543","context":"other ranks killed; 359 officers and 8,174 other ranks wounded,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_544","context":"and 23 officers and 1,728 other ranks missing. He claimed German"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_545","context":"losses of over 12,000."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_547","context":"The British soldiers who had been engaged in the fighting about"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_548","context":"Neuve Chapelle spent all of March 13, 1915, in digging trenches"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_549","context":"in the wet meadows that border the Des Layes. On the following"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_550","context":"day the two corps that had fought so valiantly were sent back to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_551","context":"the reserve."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_553","context":"The German commanders, in the meantime, had been preparing for a"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_554","context":"vigorous counterattack. They planned to make their greatest effort"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_555","context":"fifteen miles north of Neuve Chapelle, at the village of St. Eloi,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_556","context":"and trained a large section of their artillery against a part of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_557","context":"the British front, which was held by the Twenty-seventh Division."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_558","context":"The preparation of the Germans was well concealed on March 14 by"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_559","context":"the heavy mist that covered the low country. The bombardment started"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_560","context":"at 5 p. m., the beginning of which was immediately followed by the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_561","context":"explosion of two mines which were under a hillock that was a part"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_562","context":"of the British front at the southeast of St. Eloi. The artillery"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_563","context":"attack was followed by such an avalanche of German infantry that"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_564","context":"the British were driven from their trenches. This German success"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_565","context":"was followed up by the enfilading of the British lines to the right"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_566","context":"and left, with the result that that entire section of the British"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_567","context":"front was forced back."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_569","context":"That night a counterattack was prepared. It was made at 2 a. m.,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_570","context":"on March 15, by the Eighty-second Brigade, which had the Eightieth"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_571","context":"Brigade as its support. The Eighty-second Brigade drove the Germans"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_572","context":"from the village and the trenches on the east. The Eightieth Brigade"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_573","context":"finished the task of regaining all of the ground that had been"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_574","context":"lost except the crater caused by the explosion of the mines. Among"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_575","context":"the regiments that made a most enviable record for themselves in"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_576","context":"this action were Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry, the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_577","context":"Fourth Rifle Brigade, the First Leinsters, the Second Cornwalls,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_578","context":"and the Second Royal Irish Fusiliers. The \"Princess Pat's,\" as"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_579","context":"the Canadian troops were known in the home land, were the first"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_580","context":"colonial soldiers to take part in a battle of such magnitude in"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_581","context":"this war. Their valor and their ability as fighting men were causes"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_582","context":"of great pride to the British."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_584","context":"Before leaving the Neuve Chapelle engagement and what immediately"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_585","context":"followed it, it is well to give a brief survey of the actions along"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_586","context":"the line that supported it. To prevent the Germans from taking"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_587","context":"troops from various points and massing them against the main British"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_588","context":"attack, the British soldiers all along that part of the front found"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_589","context":"plenty of work to do in their immediate vicinity. Thus, on March"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_590","context":"10, 1915, the First Corps attacked the Germans from Givenchy, but"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_591","context":"there had been but little artillery fire on the part of the British"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_592","context":"there, and the wire entanglements stopped them from more than keeping"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_593","context":"the German troops in the position which they had held. The Second"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_594","context":"Corps, on March 12, was to have advanced at 10 a. m. southwest of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_595","context":"Wytschaete. The fog that prevailed on that day, however, prevented"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_596","context":"a movement until 4 p. m. Then the First Wiltshires and the Third"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_597","context":"Worcesters of the Seventh Brigade began a movement which had to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_598","context":"be abandoned when the weather thickened and night fell."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_600","context":"The attack on L'Epinette, a hamlet southeast of Armentières, was"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_601","context":"much more successful on the same day. The Seventeenth Brigade of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_602","context":"the Fourth Division of the Third Corps advanced at noon, with the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_603","context":"Eighteenth Brigade as its support. It advanced 300 yards on a front"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_604","context":"a half mile in length, carrying the village, which it retained in"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_605","context":"spite of all the counterattacks."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_607","context":"The work of the artillery was not confined to the main attack,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_608","context":"for it was very effective in shelling the Quesnoy railway station"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_609","context":"east of Armentières, where German reenforcements were boarding"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_610","context":"a train for the front. The British artillery fire was effective"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_611","context":"as far as Aubers, where it demolished a tall church spire."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_613","context":"The work of the aviators, from March 10 to 12 inclusive, deserves"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_614","context":"special mention. Owing to the adverse weather conditions, it was"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_615","context":"necessary for them to fly as low as from 100 to 150 feet above"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_616","context":"the object of their attack in order to be sure of their aim."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_617","context":"Nevertheless they destroyed one of the piers of the bridge over"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_618","context":"the Lys at Menin. This bridge carried the railroad over the river."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_619","context":"They also wrecked the railway stations at Douai, Don, and Courtrai."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_620","context":"The daring of the British aviators even took them over Lille, where"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_621","context":"they dropped bombs on one of the German headquarters."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_623","context":"To summarize the fighting about Neuve Chapelle, it may be said that"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_624","context":"the British had advanced something more than a mile on a three-mile"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_625","context":"front, replacing the sag which had existed in their line by a sag"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_658","context":"to drive the Germans from the vicinity of Lens and threaten La"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_659","context":"Bassée from the south and west. The reasons for making these plans"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_660","context":"are obvious. The German salient was a source of much danger to the"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_663","context":"of a cutting off of the entire British army and the French and"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_676","context":"before it could do any harm. \"Taubes\" bombarded the railroad junction"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_677","context":"of St. Omer and made a similar attack on Estaires on March 23."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_678","context":"Four days after another attack was made on Estaires, and on the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_679","context":"same day, March 27, the German airmen did some damage to Sailly,"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_684","context":"Aviators of the Allies, too, were busy. One of their aerial squadrons"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_689","context":"at Zeebrugge, and a flock of \"Taubes\" made a dash for their enemy's"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_690","context":"craft. The Germans were not as skillful airmen, however, and they"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_691","context":"found it necessary to retire. Five British aviators made an attack"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_692","context":"on the German submarine base at Hoboken, southwest of Antwerp,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_693","context":"and destroyed a submarine and wrecked two others. This raid was"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_695","context":"necessity of one of the aircraft to descend, which it did, only"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_696","context":"to find it had landed on Dutch territory and must be interned. The"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_736","context":"Afloat the Allies continued to maintain the supremacy which had"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_737","context":"been theirs. The French and British battleships held the left of"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_739","context":"Germans who were advancing from Ostend on Nieuport. They repeatedly"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_740","context":"bombarded the position of the kaiser's men at Westende, east of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_741","context":"Nieuport. The Germans had trained one of their mammoth pieces of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_742","context":"artillery against that town presumably because it held the sluices"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_751","context":"at Schoorbakke, north of the Yser loop, where the German trenches"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_752","context":"were shelled by French artillery. This was on the eastern border"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_756","context":"March 23 the east bank of the Yser held a Belgian division. In"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_759","context":"The Germans, however, advanced south of Dixmude. On April 1, 1915,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_760","context":"they shelled the farms and villages west of the Yser and the Yperlee"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_761","context":"Canals, and took the Driegrachten farm. Thereupon the Germans crossed"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_762","context":"the canal with three machine guns. Their plan was to proceed along"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_763","context":"the border of the inundated district to Furnes. But the French"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_764","context":"balked the plan by shelling the farm, and the Belgians finished"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_767","context":"In the meantime, from March 15 to April 17, 1915, the bombardment"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_768","context":"of Ypres was continued, destroying most of the remaining buildings"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_769","context":"there. Engagements of importance had not as yet started on the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_770","context":"British front. The British had a supply of shrapnel, and the British"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_771","context":"and French cannon, as well as the rifle- and machine-gun fire,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_772","context":"held the Germans in check until they had time to perfect their"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_774","context":"a much larger supply of ammunition before they could start on a"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_775","context":"determined campaign, which was so much desired by the troops. One"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_776","context":"of the German headquarters, however, was shelled effectively by"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_777","context":"the British on April 1, 1915, and on the following day mortars in"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_781","context":"offset this the Germans bombarded the British line at that point."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_782","context":"They also shelled Fleurbaix, which is three miles southwest of"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_784","context":"a new trench mortar south of there. On April 6, 1915, the German"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_785","context":"artillery began to be more active both north and south of the Lys,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_786","context":"and the British retaliated by shelling the railway triangle that"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_788","context":"when a mine was exploded at Le Touquet, on the north bank of the"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_793","context":"The comparative quiet along the front was broken by the fight for"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_795","context":"claims as to victory. The mound, for it was little more, getting"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_796","context":"its name on account of its height--sixty meters--was of importance"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_797","context":"only because it screened the German artillery which was shelling"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_798","context":"Ypres from the bridge to the west of Zandvoord. British trenches"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_799","context":"had been driven close to this hill by the Bedfords, whose sappers"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_800","context":"tunneled under the mound and there prepared three mines. At the same"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_801","context":"time the Germans were tunneling to plant mines under the Bedfords'"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_802","context":"trench. In this underground race the Bedfords won on the night"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_803","context":"of April 17, 1915, when they blew three big craters in the hill,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_804","context":"killing almost to a man all of the 150 Germans who were on the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_805","context":"little rise of ground. The Bedfords then dashed forward to the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_806","context":"three craters they had opened up and took a quarter of a mile of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_807","context":"the German trenches."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_809","context":"The Germans were apparently unprepared for the attack which followed"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_810","context":"the explosion of the British mines, with the result that the British"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_811","context":"had to overcome little resistance, and had ample opportunity to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_812","context":"prepare a defense from the bombardment that followed. The next"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_813","context":"morning, April 18, 1915, the German infantry in close formation"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_814","context":"advanced on the hill. This infantry was composed of Saxons, who"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_815","context":"continued on for a bayonet charge in spite of the downpour of lead"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_816","context":"that the British rained upon them. But the Bedfords had been reenforced"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_817","context":"by the West Kents and about thirty motor machine guns. The machine"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_818","context":"guns raked the charging Saxons in front, and shrapnel tore their"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_819","context":"flank. Only their dead and dying remained on the hill; but the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_820","context":"German commanders continued to send their men against the British"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_821","context":"there, who were subjected to a murderous cross-fire, the hill forming"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_822","context":"a salient. As a result of their persistence the German troops managed"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_823","context":"to get a foothold on the southern part of the hill by 6 p. m. In the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_824","context":"meantime a battalion of Highlanders and the Duke of Wellington's"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_825","context":"regiment had been sent to reenforce the Bedfords and the West Kents."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_826","context":"The Highlanders made a desperate charge, using bayonets and hand"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_827","context":"grenades on the Germans who had gained the southern edge of the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_828","context":"hill. The Germans were driven back."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_830","context":"The Duke of Württemberg, the German commander, presumably believing"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_831","context":"his troops had not only held what they had taken, but had advanced,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_832","context":"announced that another German victory had been gained in the capture"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_833","context":"of Hill 60. Sir John French also sent out a message, but in his report"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_834","context":"he set forth that Hill 60 was held by the British. Because there"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_835","context":"had been similar conflict in official reports all too frequently,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_836","context":"it seemed as if a tacit agreement was made among the neutrals to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_837","context":"determine who was telling the truth. This resulted in making what"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_838","context":"was a comparatively unimportant engagement one of the most celebrated"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_839","context":"battles of the war. As soon as Duke Albrecht of Württemberg discovered"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_840","context":"his mistake he did what he could to make good his statement by"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_841","context":"attempting to take Hill 60 without regard to sacrificing his men."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_842","context":"Sir John French was just as determined to hold the hill. So he moved"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_843","context":"large numbers of troops toward the shattered mound, the British"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_844","context":"artillery was reenforced, and the hastily constructed sandbag"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_845","context":"breastworks were improved with all possible speed."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_847","context":"The Germans then attacked with gas bombs. Projectiles filled with"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_848","context":"gas were hurled upon the British from three sides. The East Surrey"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_849","context":"Regiment, which defended the hill in the latter part of the battle"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_850","context":"for it, suffered severely. Faces and arms became shiny and gray-black."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_851","context":"Membranes in the throats thickened, and lungs seemed to be eaten"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_852","context":"by the chlorine poison. Yet the men fought on until exhausted,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_853","context":"and then fell to suffer through a death struggle which continued"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_854","context":"from twenty-four hours to three days of suffocating agony."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_856","context":"The German artillery kept up its almost incessant pounding of the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_857","context":"British. In short lulls of the big gun's work the German infantry"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_858","context":"hurled itself against the trenches on the hill, using hand grenades"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_859","context":"and bombs. The fight continued until the morning of May 5, 1915,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_860","context":"when the wind blew at about four miles an hour from the German"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_861","context":"trenches. Then a greenish-yellow fog of poisonous gas was released,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_862","context":"and soon encompassed the hill. The East Surreys, who were holding"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_863","context":"the hill, were driven back by the gas, but as soon as the gas passed"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_864","context":"they charged the Germans who had followed the gas and had taken"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_865","context":"possession of the hill. Notwithstanding the machine-gun fire which"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_866","context":"the Germans poured upon them, many of the trenches were retaken by"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_867","context":"the Surrey soldiers in their first frenzied rush to regain what"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_868","context":"they had lost because of the gas. The battle ended when there was"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_869","context":"no hill left. The bombardment and the mines had leveled the mound"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_870","context":"by distributing it over the surrounding territory. The British,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_871","context":"however, were accorded the victory, as they had trenches near where"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_872","context":"the hill was and made them a part of the base of the salient about"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_875","context":"That town has been likened to the hub of a wheel whose spokes are"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_876","context":"the roads which lead eastward. It is true that one important road"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_877","context":"went over the canal, at Steenstraate, but practically all of the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_878","context":"highways of consequence went through Ypres. Thus the spokes of the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_879","context":"wheel, whose rim was the outline of the salient, were the roads to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_880","context":"Menin, Gheluvelt, Zonnebeke, Poelcapelle, Langemarck, and Pilkem."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_881","context":"And the railroad to Roulers was also a spoke. Hence all of the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_882","context":"supplies for the troops on the salient must pass through Ypres,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_883","context":"which made it most desirable for the Germans to take the town. It"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_884","context":"will be remembered that they had won a place for their artillery"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_885","context":"early in November, 1914, which gave them an opportunity to bombard"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_886","context":"Ypres through the winter. On February 1, 1915, a portion of the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_887","context":"French troops which had held the salient were withdrawn and their"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_888","context":"places taken by General Bulfin's Twenty-eighth Division. Thus, by"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_889","context":"April 20, 1915, that part of the Allies' front was held as follows:"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_890","context":"From the canal to east of Langemarck was the Forty-fifth Division"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_916","context":"on through April 22, 1915, on the evening of which the British"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_917","context":"artillery observers reported a strange green vapor moving over the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_918","context":"French trenches. The wind was blowing steadily from the northeast."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_919","context":"Soon the French troops were staggering back from the front, blinded"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_920","context":"and choking from the deadly German gas. Many of their comrades had"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_921","context":"been unable to leave the spot where they were overtaken by the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_922","context":"fumes. Those who fled in terror rushed madly across the canal,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_923","context":"choking the road to Vlamertinghe. A part of the Zouaves and Turcos"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_924","context":"ran south toward the Langemarck road, finally reaching the reserve"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_925","context":"battalions of the Canadians. Ere long the Canadians caught the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_926","context":"deadly odor also."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_928","context":"But the work of the gas did a much more valuable thing for the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_929","context":"German troops than causing the agonizing death of many hundreds"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_930","context":"and sending thousands in headlong flight. It made a four-mile-wide"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_931","context":"opening in the front of the Allies. And the Germans were quick to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_932","context":"take advantage of that opening. They followed the gas, and were"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_933","context":"aided in their advance by artillery fire. The French were forced"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_934","context":"back on the canal from Steenstraate to Boesinghe. The Canadians"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_935","context":"had not suffered so much from the gas as the French soldiers, but"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_936","context":"their flank was too exposed for them to do much effective work"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_937","context":"against the onrushing Teutons. The attempt to rally the Turcos"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_938","context":"failed. The Third Brigade could not withstand the attack of four"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_939","context":"divisions, and was forced inward from a point south of Poelcappelle"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_940","context":"until its left rested on the wood east of St. Julien. There was"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_941","context":"a gap beyond it, and the Germans were forcing their way around"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_942","context":"its flank. Because the entire First Brigade of Canadians had been"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_943","context":"held in reserve it could not be brought up in time to save the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_944","context":"situation. Two of the battalions, the Sixteenth and Tenth, were"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_945","context":"in the gap by midnight. They charged and recovered the northern"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_946","context":"edge, and the guns of the Second London Division, which had been"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_947","context":"supporting the French in the wood east of St. Julien. But the British"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_948","context":"could not hold all they retook, and were forced to abandon the guns"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_949","context":"because the artillery horses were miles away. So parts of the guns"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_950","context":"were made useless before the Germans had them again."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_952","context":"Then another counterattack was made by the First and Fourth Ontarios"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_953","context":"of General Mercer's First Brigade. The Fourth Ontario captured the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_954","context":"German shelter trenches and held them for two days, when they were"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_955","context":"relieved. The Third Canadian Brigade held its position in spite"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_956","context":"of being opposed by many times their numbers and almost overcome"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_957","context":"by the gas fumes. The Forty-eighth Highlanders, who had had to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_958","context":"withstand the gas, rallied after their retreat and regained their"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_959","context":"former place in the front. The Royal Highlanders kept their original"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_960","context":"position. Yet there was every indication of a rout. The roads were"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_961","context":"clogged by the night supply trains going forward and the rush of men"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_962","context":"trying to escape from the deadly gas. The staff officers found it"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_963","context":"impossible to straighten out the tangle, and the various regiments"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_964","context":"had to act almost as independent bodies, It was not until early the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_965","context":"following morning, April 23, 1915, that the first reenforcements"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_966","context":"of British soldiers appeared to fill the breach. These men, for"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_967","context":"the most part, were from the Twenty-eighth Division, and had been"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_968","context":"east of Zonnebeke to the southeast corner of Polygon Wood. So great"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_969","context":"was the pressure at the section where the break had been made in"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_970","context":"the line that troops were taken from wherever available, so that"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_971","context":"the units in the gap varied from day to day. For the men had to be"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_972","context":"returned to their original positions, such as remained available,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_973","context":"as soon as possible. This composite body of troops has been called"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_974","context":"Geddes's Detachment."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_976","context":"The Germans had captured Lizerne and Het Sas, and Steenstraate was"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_977","context":"threatened by them. They bombarded with heavy artillery, located"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_978","context":"on the Passchendaele ridge, the front held by the Canadians, the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_979","context":"Twenty-eighth Division, and Geddes's Detachment, on April 23, 1915."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_980","context":"The severest fighting was on that part of the front held by the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_981","context":"Third Brigade of Canadians. Many men had been killed or wounded in"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_982","context":"this brigade, and those who survived were ill from the effects of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_983","context":"the gas. Furthermore, no food could be taken to them for twenty-four"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_984","context":"hours. Moreover, they were subjected to a fire from three sides,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_985","context":"with the result that they were forced to a new position on a line"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_986","context":"running through St. Julien. Finally the Germans forced their way"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_987","context":"around to the left of the Third Brigade, establishing their machine"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_988","context":"guns behind it."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_990","context":"A terrific artillery attack was started by the Germans on the morning"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_991","context":"of April 24, 1915, and this was followed by a second rush of gas"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_992","context":"from their trenches. It rose in a cloud seven feet high and was"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_993","context":"making its attack on the British in two minutes after it started."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_994","context":"It was thickest near the ground, being pumped from cylinders. And"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_995","context":"it worked with the same deadly effect. The Third Brigade, receiving"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_996","context":"its second attack of this sort before it had recovered from the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_997","context":"first, retreated to the southwest of St. Julien, but soon after"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_998","context":"regained most of their lost position. The Second Brigade had to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_999","context":"bend its left south. Colonel Lipsett's Eighth Battalion, however,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1000","context":"held fast on the Grafenstafel ridge, remaining in their position"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1001","context":"two days in spite of the gas of which they got a plentiful supply."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1003","context":"By noon of April 24, 1915, the Germans made an attack on the village"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1004","context":"of St. Julien and that part of the allied front to the east of the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1005","context":"village. Thereupon the Third Brigade retreated about 700 yards to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1006","context":"a new front south of the village and north of the hamlet of Fortuin."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1007","context":"But what remained of the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Battalions was"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1008","context":"forced by circumstances to remain in the St. Julien line until"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1009","context":"late that night. Colonel Lipsett's Eighth Battalion at Grafenstafel,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1010","context":"in spite of its left being unsupported, held its position which"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1011","context":"was of great importance to the British front. For, had that part"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1012","context":"of the front been lost, the Germans in an hour could have worked"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1013","context":"their way back of the Twenty-eighth Division and the entire eastern"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1016","context":"In the meantime the French on the western section of the front"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1017","context":"made a counterattack from the canal with partial success; but were"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1018","context":"unable to drive the German troops from the sector entirely. The"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1019","context":"Teutons took Steenstraate; but their victory there was marred by"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1020","context":"the fact that the Belgian artillery smashed the bridge behind them."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1021","context":"By this time the British reenforcements began to arrive in fairly"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1022","context":"large numbers. The Thirteenth Brigade of the Fifth Division was"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1023","context":"placed to the west of Geddes's Detachment, between the Pilkem road"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1024","context":"and the canal. Territorials who had arrived from England only three"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1025","context":"days before, the Durham and York Brigades of the Northumbrian Division,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1026","context":"supported the Thirteenth Brigade. The Tenth Brigade of the Fourth"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1027","context":"Division were rushed to support the Third Brigade of Canadians"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1028","context":"who were south of St. Julien. Other British troops were sent to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1029","context":"relieve the tense situation at Grafenstafel."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1031","context":"An attempt to retake St. Julien was made early on Sunday morning,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1032","context":"April 25, 1915, by General Hull's Tenth Brigade and two battalions"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1033","context":"of the Durham and York Brigade. The British worked their way to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1034","context":"the few Canadians who had continued on the former front when the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1035","context":"main British force had been driven back. There they were checked"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1036","context":"by the German machine gun fire. The British lost many men here and"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1037","context":"the efforts to save the day resulted in such a mixture of fighting"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1038","context":"units that there were fifteen battalions under General Hull, as"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1039","context":"well as the Canadian artillery."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1041","context":"At Grafenstafel the Eighth Battalion of the Durham Brigade were"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1042","context":"bombarded with asphyxiating shells before the German infantry attack."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1043","context":"The fighting on this section of the front was fierce throughout"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1044","context":"the afternoon, but finally the British were forced to retire. At"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1045","context":"Broodseinde, the extreme eastern point of the allied front, the Germans"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1046","context":"made a desperate attempt to take the salient, using asphyxiating"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1047","context":"and other bombs again and again on the men of the Twenty-eighth"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1048","context":"Division of the British. King George's men, however, repelled the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1049","context":"attacks with severe loss to the Teutons, taking many prisoners."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1051","context":"The French on the left, beyond the Yperlee Canal, prevented the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1052","context":"advance of the German troops; and, farther to the left, the Belgians"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1053","context":"checked three attacks in which asphyxiating gas was used, south"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1054","context":"of Dixmude. Thus it may be seen that the Germans had met with no"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1055","context":"success worth while, when Sunday, April 25, 1915, closed, so far"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1056","context":"as the ends of the salient were concerned; but in the center the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1057","context":"British situation was so critical that the Second Canadian Brigade,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1058","context":"reduced to less than 1,000 men, was once more called into action"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1059","context":"on the following day. On the same day, April 26, 1915, the Lahore"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1060","context":"Division of the Indian army was marched north of Ypres. The point of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1061","context":"the salient was pushed in on that day at Broodseinde, but the German"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1062","context":"success there was short-lived. The brigade holding Grafenstafel was"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1063","context":"attacked fiercely by the Germans. The Durham Light Infantry was"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1064","context":"forced from Fortuin behind the Haanabeek River. The Teutons made"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1065","context":"several attacks from the St. Julien district against the section"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1066","context":"between the Yperlee Canal and the southern part of the village. By"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1067","context":"this time Geddes's Detachment was almost exhausted, they, with the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1068","context":"Canadians, having withstood the heaviest fighting at the beginning"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1069","context":"of the battle; and most likely saved the Allies a most disastrous"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1070","context":"defeat. The detachment could stand no more, and the various units"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1071","context":"of which it was composed were returned to their respective commands."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1073","context":"But the salient was growing smaller as a result of the repeated"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1074","context":"hammering of the Germans; and that exposed the allied troops to a"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1075","context":"more deadly fire from three sides. It was evident that the Allies"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1076","context":"must make a counterattack. General Riddell's Brigade was sent to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1077","context":"Fortuin and with the Lahore Division on its left was told to retake"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1078","context":"St. Julien and the woods to the west of the village. Beyond the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1079","context":"Yperlee Canal, on the left, the French made an assault on Lizerne,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1080","context":"supported by the Belgian artillery; while the French colonial soldiers"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1081","context":"poured on Pilkem from the sector about Boesinghe. On the right the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1082","context":"allied troops were lined up as follows: the Connaught Rangers,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1083","context":"Fifty-seventh Wilde's Rifles, the Ferozepore Brigade, the 129th"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1084","context":"Baluchis, the Jullundur Brigade, and General Riddell's battalions."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1085","context":"The Sirhind Brigade was held in reserve."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1087","context":"The German artillerymen apparently knew the distances and topography"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1088","context":"of the entire region and poured a leaden hail upon the allied troops."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1089","context":"The Indians and the British in their immediate neighborhood charged"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1090","context":"in short rushes, losing many men in the attempt to reach the German"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1091","context":"trenches. Before the Germans were in any danger of a hand-to-hand"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1092","context":"struggle, they sent one of their gas clouds from their trenches"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1093","context":"and the attack was abandoned, the British and Indians getting back"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1094","context":"to their trenches as best they could. In this action the British"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1095","context":"gave great praise to their comrades from India. Riddell's Brigade"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1096","context":"was stopped in its attack on St. Julien by wire entanglements;"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1097","context":"and, though the outlaying sections of St. Julien were captured,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1098","context":"the brigade was unable to hold them; and the Germans continued to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1099","context":"hold the woods west of the village. Nevertheless the British front"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1100","context":"had been pushed forward from 600 to 700 yards in some places."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1102","context":"By that night, the night of April 26, 1915, the allied front extended"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1103","context":"from the north of Zonnebeke to the eastern boundary of the Grafenstafel"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1104","context":"ridge; thence southwest along the southern side of the Haanabeek"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1105","context":"to a point a half mile east of St. Julien; thence, bending around"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1106","context":"that village, it ran to Vamhuele--called the \"shell trap\"--farm"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1107","context":"on the Ypres-Poelcappelle road. Next it proceeded to Boesinghe"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1108","context":"and crossed the Yperlee Canal, passing northward of Lizerne after"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1109","context":"which were the French and the Belgians."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1111","context":"The work of the allied aviators on April 26, 1915, deserves more"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1112","context":"than passing consideration in the record of that day's fighting."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1113","context":"They dropped bombs on the stations of Courtrai, Roubaix, Thielt,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1114","context":"and Staden. They discovered near Langemarck an armored train with"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1115","context":"the result that it was shelled and thus forced to return. And they"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1116","context":"forced a German aviator to the ground at Roulers."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1118","context":"The Lahore Division with the French on their left attacked the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1119","context":"Germans on April 27, 1915, but they met with little success because"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1120","context":"of the gas which the Teutons sent into the ranks of the attacking"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1121","context":"party. But the German troops had lost so heavily that they did"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1122","context":"not seem to be inclined to follow up their apparent advantage."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1123","context":"Incidentally the Allies needed a rest as well. Hence there was"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1124","context":"little fighting the next two days. On April 30, 1915, however,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1125","context":"General Putz attacked the Germans with so much force that they"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1126","context":"were hurled back an appreciable distance near Pilkem. Seven machine"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1127","context":"guns and 200 prisoners were taken, and the 214th, 215th, and 216th"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1128","context":"German regiments lost more than 1,000 men. On the same day the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1129","context":"London Rifle Brigade, further east, drove back a German forward"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1130","context":"movement from St. Julien."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1132","context":"West of the Yperlee Canal, however, it soon became known to the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1133","context":"commanders of the allied forces that the Germans were in such a"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1134","context":"strong position that it would be impossible to dislodge their enemy"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1135","context":"until much greater preparations had been made. In the meantime"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1136","context":"the communications of the Allies were in danger. Hence Sir John"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1137","context":"French on May 1, 1915, ordered Sir Herbert Plumer to retreat. The"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1138","context":"wisdom of this order, the execution of which contracted the southern"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1139","context":"portion of the salient, was seen when the Germans again attempted"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1140","context":"to force their way through the allied front by the use of gas. The"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1141","context":"attempt this time was made between Zonnebeke, on the Ypres-Roulers"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1142","context":"railroad, and Boesinghe on the Yperlee Canal on Sunday, May 2,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1143","context":"1915. Though the British had been supplied with respirators of a"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1144","context":"sort, these means of defense were not as effective as they should"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1145","context":"have been nor as adequate as what was provided later. The Germans,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1146","context":"however, suffered large losses in this attack because, as soon"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1147","context":"as the wall of gas began to approach the British trenches, the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1148","context":"men there fired into it, well knowing from past experience that"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1149","context":"the Germans were following the gas. In this manner many of the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1150","context":"Teutons were slain. The Allies adopted other tactics which were"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1151","context":"quite as effective. On seeing the gas approaching, the soldiers"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1152","context":"in some parts of the line proceeded to execute a flank movement,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1153","context":"thereby getting away from the gas and subjecting the Germans to"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1213","context":"Yperlee Canal on May 4, 1915, was stopped by a combination of machine"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1214","context":"guns, asphyxiating gas and fog. Then the French spent the next"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1219","context":"find only that the British position had been changed. But they"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1220","context":"intrenched opposite the new alignment, and brought up their big"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1221","context":"guns. Then they used poisonous gas again with the result that the"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1224","context":"The greater part of this action took place around Hill 60, and some"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1225","context":"of the British trenches to the north of the hill were captured by"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1228","context":"however, the British drove them from the hill only to be driven"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1229","context":"away in turn by the use of asphyxiating gas. On the following day"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1230","context":"the Teutons held Hill 60 and some of the trenches north of it."}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1234","context":"the Ypres-Roulers railroad. Though this attack failed, the Teutons"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1235","context":"were ready to make as near superhuman efforts as possible because"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1236","context":"they knew that the French were getting ready for a decisive action"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1237","context":"in the Arras territory, which would have the aid of a British attack"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1238","context":"south of the Lys. Hence it was to the advantage of the Germans to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1239","context":"force Sir John French and General Foch to retain most of the British"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1240","context":"and French soldiers north of the Lys. On May 8, 1915, they turned"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1241","context":"their artillery on that part of the British front that was near"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1242","context":"Frezenberg. It destroyed the trenches and killed or wounded hundreds"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1243","context":"of the defenders. After three hours of this, the Germans commenced"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1244","context":"an attack on that part of the British front between the Ypres-Menin"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1245","context":"and the Ypres-Poelcappelle highways, the greatest pressure being"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1246","context":"brought to bear along both sides of the Ypres-Roulers railroad."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1248","context":"The British fought bravely, but it was impossible for them to hold"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1249","context":"out against the avalanche of lead. First the right of a brigade"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1250","context":"went to pieces and then its center and the left of another brigade"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1251","context":"south of it were forced back. Princess Patricia's Canadian Light"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1252","context":"Infantry held fast. The Second Essex Regiment also made some little"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1253","context":"success for their side by annihilating a small detachment of Germans;"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1254","context":"but that was more than offset by the breaking of the center of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1255","context":"another brigade, after which the First Suffolks were surrounded"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1256","context":"and put out of the fight. Finally the Germans pushed their way"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1257","context":"on to Frezenberg. Sir Herbert Plumer realized by the middle of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1258","context":"the afternoon that a counterattack was necessary. He had held two"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1259","context":"battalions in reserve along the Ypres-Menin Road. He also had five"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1260","context":"battalions with him and reenforcements in the form of a brigade"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1261","context":"of infantry had arrived at Vlamertinghe Château, back of Ypres."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1262","context":"He sent the First Royal Warwickshires, the Second Royal Dublin"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1263","context":"Fusiliers, the Second Surreys, the Third Middlesex, and the First"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1264","context":"York and Lancaster Regiments into the break in the line with the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1265","context":"result that Frezenberg was retaken. This victory was short-lived,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1266","context":"however; for the German machine-gun fire was too fierce for the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1267","context":"men to withstand. The British retired to a new front which ran"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1268","context":"north and south through Verlorenhoek. The Twelfth London Regiment,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1269","context":"on the left, though it lost many men, managed to get to the original"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1270","context":"line of trenches. Next the British were menaced from the north"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1271","context":"and east. Great bodies of Teutons rushed from the woods south of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1272","context":"the Menin highway, when others rushed down the Poelcappelle Road"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1273","context":"and took Wieltje, which is only about two miles from Ypres."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1275","context":"The fighting continued all night, but shortly after midnight the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1276","context":"British charged with the bayonet and retook Wieltje as well as"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1277","context":"most of that section to the north of it which they had lost. Early"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1278","context":"on May 9, 1915, the fighting was continued, and, in the afternoon,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1279","context":"the Germans charged from the woods in a vain attempt to take Ypres"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1280","context":"after a severe bombardment of the British trenches. An attacking"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1281","context":"party of five hundred was slain north of the town. On the eastern"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1282","context":"side of the salient there were five distinct attacks. An attempt"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1283","context":"to capture the Château Hooge was made early in the evening, only"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1284","context":"to result in heaping the ground with German dead. The day closed"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1285","context":"with 150 yards of British trenches in the hands of the Germans;"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1286","context":"but they had been taken at a fearful cost to the kaiser's men."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1288","context":"The Germans began the next day, May 10, 1915, by shelling the British"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1289","context":"north and south of the Ypres-Menin road. They followed the cannonade"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1290","context":"with a cloud of asphyxiating gas. They then started for the opposing"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1291","context":"trenches. Many of them, the British allege, wore British uniforms."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1292","context":"The British had by now been equipped with proper respirators and"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1293","context":"could withstand a gas attack with comparative ease. When the Germans"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1294","context":"were in close range they received a rifle and machine-gun fire"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1295","context":"that mowed them down almost instantly. Those who had not been shot"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1296","context":"fell to the ground to escape the leaden hail. But escape was not"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1297","context":"for them. Shrapnel was poured upon them, and nearly all of the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1298","context":"attacking troops perished."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1300","context":"Another gas attack was made between the Ypres-Menin road and the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1301","context":"Ypres-Comines canal. There two batteries of gas cylinders sent"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1302","context":"forth their deadly fumes for more than a half hour. The cloud that"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1303","context":"resulted became so dense that it was impossible for the British"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1304","context":"in the opposite trenches to see anything; so they were withdrawn"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1305","context":"temporarily; but the troops to the left and right kept the Germans"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1306","context":"from following up this advantage and the trenches were saved to the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1307","context":"British. When the gas had passed away the men returned to their"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1308","context":"former position. North of the Menin road, however, the Germans"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1309","context":"were successful in driving the Fourth Rifle Brigade and the Third"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1310","context":"King's Royal Rifles to a new position, the trenches which the British"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1311","context":"occupied having been battered by shell fire to such an extent that"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1312","context":"some of the occupants were buried alive. Hence the British here"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1313","context":"retreated to a new line of trenches west of the Bellewaarde Wood"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1314","context":"where the trees had been shelled until they were part of a hopeless"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1315","context":"entanglement rather than a forest."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1317","context":"The next day, May 11, 1915, was started by the Germans hurling"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1318","context":"hundreds of incendiary shells into the already ruined town of Ypres."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1319","context":"They also fired almost countless high-explosive shells into the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1320","context":"British trenches. The British big guns replied with considerable"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1321","context":"effect. One of the German cannon was rendered useless by the fire of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1322","context":"the Thirty-first Heavy Battery, and several howitzers were damaged by"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1323","context":"the North Midland Heavy Battery. The German cannonade was especially"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1324","context":"effective near the Ypres-St. Julien road. The Teutons, however,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1325","context":"did not confine their work to the artillery, for they made three"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1326","context":"assaults on the British trenches south of the Menin road. This"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1327","context":"part of the line was held by Scottish regiments, who, though they"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1328","context":"were forced out of their trenches, regained them with the aid of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1329","context":"other Scots who were supporting them."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1331","context":"By now it was apparent to the British commanding officers that"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1332","context":"they must still further lessen the projection of their salient."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1333","context":"So on May 12, 1915, the Twenty-eighth Division was sent to the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1334","context":"reserve. It had experienced continuous fighting since April 22,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1335","context":"1915, and had suffered severe losses. It had only one lieutenant"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1336","context":"colonel. Captains were in command of most of its battalions. The"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1337","context":"First and Third Cavalry Divisions took its place. They were under"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1338","context":"the command of General De Lisle. From left to right the new line"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1339","context":"was held as follows: The men of the Twelfth Brigade, the Eleventh"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1340","context":"Brigade, and a battalion of the Tenth Brigade of the Fourth Division"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1341","context":"guarded the new front to a point northeast of Verlorenhoek. Next"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1342","context":"came the First Cavalry which held the line to the Roulers railroad."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1343","context":"From the railroad to Bellewaarde Lake the Third Division held the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1344","context":"line. From the lake to Hill 60 the Twenty-seventh Division had"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1345","context":"its position. The British admitted that this new position was not"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1346","context":"strong, because it lacked natural advantages, and the trenches"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1347","context":"were more or less of hasty construction."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1349","context":"The Germans started a heavy bombardment of the cavalry on May 13,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1350","context":"1915, when the rain was pouring in torrents and a north wind was"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1351","context":"adding to the discomforts of the British. The fiercest part of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1352","context":"this attack was on the Third Division. Some idea of the fierceness"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1353","context":"of the bombardment can be gained when it is known that in a"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1354","context":"comparatively short space of time more than eight hundred shells"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1355","context":"were hurled on a part of the British line which was not more than"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1356","context":"a mile in length. In places the British were buried alive. In spite"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1357","context":"of the destructive fire, the North Somerset Yeomanry, commanded by"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1358","context":"Lieutenant Colonel Glyn, charged the Germans who were advancing"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1359","context":"on their trenches under cover of the bombardment. The charge was"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1360","context":"effective, and the Teutons were driven headlong toward their own"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1361","context":"trenches. But the German artillery had the range of the Seventh"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1362","context":"Brigade on the right, and poured upon it such a fire that it retreated"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1363","context":"several hundred yards, leaving the right of the Sixth Brigade exposed."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1364","context":"As soon as possible the British made an attempt to remedy the defect"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1365","context":"in their line, and found it necessary to make a counterattack. In"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1366","context":"this counterattack very satisfactory results were obtained by the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1367","context":"use of the Duke of Westminster's armored motor cars. The British"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1368","context":"regained the lost ground, but they found it impossible to retain"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1369","context":"it, for the Teuton's heavy artillery had the range of the position"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1370","context":"so accurately that no man could live there. The result of the day's"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1371","context":"fighting was a farther pushing back of the line of the British"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1372","context":"so that it bent backward from Verlorenhoek and Bellewaarde Lake."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1373","context":"In addition to being forced back, the British suffered a large"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1374","context":"loss of men, especially officers."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1376","context":"The infantry on the left had been fiercely attacked on this same"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1377","context":"day; but it managed to keep from being driven from its position."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1378","context":"One of the defenders of this part of the line was a territorial"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1379","context":"battalion, the London Rifle Brigade. There were only 278 men in the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1380","context":"battalion at the beginning of the day, it having suffered severe"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1381","context":"losses previously. By night ninety-one more had been lost. Four"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1382","context":"survivors, under command of Sergeant Douglas Belcher, and two hussars"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1383","context":"whom the sergeant had added to his squad, held that part of the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1384","context":"line in the face of repeated attacks. These plucky men not only"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1385","context":"made the Germans think the front was strongly defended there by"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1386","context":"using quick-firing methods, but they undoubtedly saved the right"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1387","context":"of the Fourth Division. Another especially gallant piece of work on"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1388","context":"the part of the British was done by the Second Essex, the reserve"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1389","context":"battalion of the Twelfth Brigade. With a bayonet charge they drove"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1390","context":"the Germans from Shelltrap Farm, which was between the Langemarck"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1391","context":"and Poelcappelle highways, and, though it was held by first one"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1392","context":"side and then the other, the British had it at the close of the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1393","context":"day in spite of the bombardment it received."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1395","context":"[Illustration: GAS BATTLE OF YPRES]"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1397","context":"The French met with better success on the British left. Under the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1398","context":"command of General Putz they made an attack on Het Sase and"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1399","context":"Steenstraate. The sharpshooters of the Zouaves and Algerians took"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1400","context":"a trench in front of the latter place and entered the village."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1401","context":"They fought on to the canal by the end of that day, which was May"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1402","context":"15, 1915. More than six hundred Teuton dead were counted after"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1403","context":"that engagement. At the same time the Zouaves captured Het Sase"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1404","context":"with great ease, because the artillery had rendered its defenders"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1405","context":"useless for more fighting. The Germans, however, were not inclined"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1406","context":"to give up the town so easily. They bombarded Het Sase that night,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1407","context":"using asphyxiating shells. Nothing daunted, the Zouaves put on"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1408","context":"their respirators and drove off with hand grenades and rifle fire"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1412","context":"French had destroyed three German regiments, taken three redoubts, and"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1450","context":"inflicted as much of a blow as the other, to all intents and purposes,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1451","context":"for there had been an almost prodigal waste of human life and"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1455","context":"Britain, on the other hand, had lost no strategical advantage by"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1488","context":"on the following day, March 26, 1915, when the Chasseurs stormed"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1489","context":"the height, and, after fighting for six hours, gained the top and"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1490","context":"captured 400 prisoners. But the Germans had no intention of giving"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1491","context":"their opponents such a hold on the control of the valley of the"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1494","context":"While the Germans were attempting to retake the summit, the French"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1495","context":"were making desperate efforts to drive the Teutons from the eastern"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1498","context":"During the next month, May, both sides made claims of success;"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1499","context":"but what each actually possessed was as follows: The French had"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1500","context":"the top and all of the western portion; the Germans possessed the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1501","context":"summit ridge, and the east and northeast portions. But, until the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1502","context":"French held the entire mountain, they could make little use of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1503","context":"it in controlling the Ill Valley."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1505","context":"The fighting in the other part of the Vosges had to do principally"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1506","context":"with the valley of the Fecht. The stream runs from Schlucht and"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1507","context":"Bramont east, and proceeds past Münster and Metzeral. On its right"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1508","context":"bank is the railroad from Colmar to Metzeral. The heights in the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1509","context":"upper part of the valley were held by the Chasseurs Alpins; and"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1510","context":"they desired to take both towns. Throughout the month of April"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1511","context":"the French were fairly successful on both banks of the river. The"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1512","context":"spur above Metzeral to the northwest was taken by them. The ridge"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1513","context":"between the two valleys was captured by the French on April 17,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1514","context":"1915. The fighting here was continued throughout May, 1915."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1516","context":"The next scene of activity was north, where there was a wooded"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1517","context":"plateau between the Moselle and the Meuse. Here the Germans had a"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1518","context":"salient which was long and quite narrow. The point of this salient"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1519","context":"was at St. Mihiel, the other side of the Meuse. This point was well"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1520","context":"protected by the artillery at Camp des Romains, which controlled"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1521","context":"the section for ten miles in any direction. To the north of the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1522","context":"salient there was a railroad from Etain to Metz. There was another"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1523","context":"line twenty miles to the south. This ran from Metz to Thiaucourt"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1524","context":"by the Rupt de Mad. The village of Vigneulles was about in the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1525","context":"center of the narrow part of the salient, and on the road to St."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1526","context":"Mihiel. There was a better road to the south through Apremont. A"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1527","context":"strategic railroad had been built from Thiaucourt by Vigneulles"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1528","context":"to St. Mihiel, down the Gap of Spada, which is an opening between"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1529","context":"the hills of the Meuse Valley. The plateau of Les Eparges is north"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1530","context":"of Vigneulles. The plateau is approximately 1,000 feet above the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1531","context":"sea level, and forms the eastern border of the heights of the Meuse."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1532","context":"There was high land on the southern side of the salient, along"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1533","context":"which ran the main road from Commercy to Pont-a-Mousson. Within the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1534","context":"salient the land was rough and, to a considerable extent, covered"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1535","context":"with wood."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1537","context":"The French did not plan to make an attack on the salient at its"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1538","context":"apex. The artillery at Camp des Romains would be too effective. The"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1539","context":"French plan was to press in the sides of the salient and finally"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1540","context":"control the St. Mihiel communications. The southeastern side of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1541","context":"the salient, at the beginning of April, 1915, extended from St."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1542","context":"Mihiel to Camp des Romains, thence to Bois d'Ailly, Apremont,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1543","context":"Boudonville, Regnieville, and finally to the Moselle, three miles"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1544","context":"north of Pont-a-Mousson. The northwestern side was marked by an"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1545","context":"imaginary line drawn from Etain in the north past Fresnes, over"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1546","context":"the Les Eparges Heights, and thence by Lamorville and Spada to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1547","context":"St. Mihiel. The place of most importance, from a military point"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1548","context":"of view, was the Les Eparges plateau, which controlled the greater"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1549","context":"part of the northern section of the salient. The taking of this"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1550","context":"plateau would naturally be the first step in capturing Vigneulles."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1551","context":"But the Germans had converted Les Eparges into what had the appearance"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1552","context":"of being an impregnable fort, when they took it on September 21,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1553","context":"1914. Their trenches lined the slopes, and everything had been"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1554","context":"made secure for a possible siege. The French in February and March,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1555","context":"1915, however, had taken the village of Les Eparges and a portion"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1556","context":"of the steep side on the northwest. But of necessity they made"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1557","context":"progress slowly, because they were in such an exposed position"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1558","context":"whenever they sought the top. They had planned an assault for April"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1559","context":"5, 1915, and, in a heavy rain, with the slope a great mass of deep"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1560","context":"mud, the French gained some territory. This they were unable to hold"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1561","context":"when the Germans made a counterattack on the following morning,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1562","context":"April 6, 1915. That night the soldiers of the republic forced their"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1563","context":"way up with the bayonet, taking 1,500 yards of trenches, by the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1564","context":"morning of April 7, 1915. Thereupon the Germans brought up"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1565","context":"reenforcements, which were rendered useless by the French artillery,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1566","context":"which prevented them from going forward to the battle line. The"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1567","context":"German artillery used the same tactics, with the result that the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1568","context":"French reenforcements were kept out of the fight. After the cannons"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1569","context":"had completed their work, both sides were apparently willing to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1570","context":"rest for the remainder of the day. But on the morning of April"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1571","context":"8, 1915, two regiments of infantry and a battalion of Chasseurs"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1572","context":"forced their way to the top, which they took after an hour's hard"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1573","context":"fighting. That pushed the Germans back to the eastern slope. Then"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1574","context":"the battle was fought on during the remainder of the day, which"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1575","context":"found the French, at its close, in possession of all except a little"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1582","context":"required by the hardy French troops to go up to relieve their comrades"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1583","context":"who gained the top. This relief was not sent until the following"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1584","context":"day, April 9, 1915. On that day the Germans in the little triangle"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1585","context":"were driven off or slain. One of the sudden and dense fogs of the"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1590","context":"The importance of this achievement to the Allies is not likely to"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1592","context":"district, and its capture by the French was one of the most heroic"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1593","context":"feats of the war. The Germans placed as high a value on the height"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1594","context":"for military purposes as the French. They had spent the winter in"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1595","context":"adding to what nature had made nearly perfect--the impregnability"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1596","context":"of the entire sector. They intrusted its defense, when an attack"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1600","context":"French to climb the slimy sides, which were swept by machine-gun"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1601","context":"fire. The Germans knew the exact range of every square foot of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1602","context":"the slopes. There was no place that offered even a slight shelter"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1603","context":"for the attacking force. The weather was at its worst. Yet, in"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1608","context":"It is true the Teutons occupied the lesser spur of Combres; but"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1610","context":"from it without subjecting the attacking party to a leaden hail from"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1611","context":"St. Remy and Les Eparges. But the German salient still remained,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1612","context":"and the French continued their pressure on it. They pushed forward"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1613","context":"in the north to Etain, and took the hills on the right bank of the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1614","context":"Orne, which hampered their enemy in his use of the Etain-Conflans"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1615","context":"railroad. They closed in on the reentrant of the salient to the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1616","context":"north--Gussainville; and they used the same tactics in regard to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1617","context":"Lamorville, because it dominated the Gap of Spada; and to the north of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1618","context":"it they exerted a pressure on the Bois de la Selouse. The engagements"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1619","context":"on the south of the salient were fought desperately. The part of the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1620","context":"top which falls away to the Rupt de Mad was held by the French. That"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1621","context":"section is covered with a low wood, which develops into presentable"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1622","context":"forests in the region toward the Moselle Valley to the east. The"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1728","context":"half. On the left the French were unable to maintain such speed,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1729","context":"because of the many ravines. They took the outlying sections of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1730","context":"Carency, and worked their way eastward, cutting the road to Souchez."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1731","context":"At the end of the first day the French had to their credit three"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1743","context":"before, they suddenly received an order to remain where they were"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1745","context":"a German counterattack getting under way near the sugar factory"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1746","context":"at Souchez. Preparatory to the Teuton advance the German artillery"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1751","context":"working favorably, the Germans advanced, only to be mowed down"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1752","context":"by the French guns. Then the French infantry charged and gained"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1753","context":"another trench line. So eager were the younger French soldiers"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1754","context":"that some of those who charged from the south were not content with"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1755","context":"taking the trench which was their objective point, but dashed on"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1756","context":"into a ravine that extended in the direction of Ablain. There they"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1757","context":"killed or made prisoners of the Germans they found. This dash was"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1759","context":"which luckily for the French did not occur as the Teutons retired to"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1768","context":"allow freedom of action in using rifle and bayonet, the rifle is"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1769","context":"generally slung on the man's back in bandolier, and the fighting"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1770","context":"within the trenches is done with short weapons, especially with"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1777","context":"unsuccessful counterattack was made that night from the Spur of"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1779","context":"Angres and the machine guns in Ablain, and their discomforts were"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1780","context":"added to by the work of the bursting shells which opened the graves"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1785","context":"the afternoon of May 12, 1915. The Germans captured there made"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1786","context":"a total of more than 5,000 prisoners taken by the French. Notre"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1787","context":"Dame de Lorette with its chapel and fort was also taken this same"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1792","context":"A north wind and a heavy rain added to the discomforts of the soldiers"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1793","context":"on May 13, 1915. But physical discomforts were not all that made"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1794","context":"for more or less unhappiness. The Germans had little reason to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1795","context":"be happy; but the French had the edge taken from their elation,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1796","context":"because of their victory, by the fact that it seemed as if it must"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1797","context":"be won again before it would be of use to them. According to the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1798","context":"rules of the war game the German line had been broken and the French"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1799","context":"had made for themselves a right of way; but there were many instances"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1800","context":"in this war where the rules were not followed; and this was one"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1801","context":"of the exceptions. It is true the German line had been smashed,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1802","context":"but it had not fallen back. Instead the remnants of the line had"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1803","context":"collected themselves in the series of independent redoubts which"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1804","context":"had seemingly been prepared for just such an emergency. They were"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1805","context":"so situated that it was well-nigh impossible to destroy them at"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1806","context":"long range; but it was impossible to make any forward movement"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1807","context":"which would not be enfiladed by them. Hence it became necessary"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1808","context":"for the French, if they were to be really victorious, to reduce"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1809","context":"each separate redoubt. The most prominent of these were the sugar"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1810","context":"factory at Souchez, the cemetery at Ablain, the White Road on a"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1811","context":"spur of the Lorette, the eastern portion of Neuville St. Vaast,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1812","context":"and the Labyrinth. The last named was so called because it was"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1813","context":"an elaborate system of trenches and redoubts in an angle between"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1814","context":"two roads. The White Road surrendered on May 21, 1915. Ablain was"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1815","context":"taken on May 29, 1915. The Souchez sugar factory fell on May 31,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1816","context":"1915. Neuville St. Vaast was captured on June 8, 1915. The Labyrinth,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1817","context":"however, remained under German control. Part of it was fifty feet"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1818","context":"below the surface of the earth, much of the fighting there being"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1819","context":"carried on in underground galleries and by means of mines. It finally"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1820","context":"was entirely in the hands of the French on June 19, 1915, after"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1821","context":"being taken to a considerable extent foot by foot. The last of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1822","context":"the fighting there was in what was known as the Eulenburg Passage,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1823","context":"where the entire 161st German Regiment, consisting of 4,000 men,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1824","context":"were slain and a Bavarian regiment suffered a heavy loss in killed"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1825","context":"and wounded. The French took 1,000 prisoners; and only 2,000 of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1826","context":"their own men were unable to answer roll call after the fight,"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1831","context":"In concluding the account of the battle of the Artois it may be"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1832","context":"admitted that the French had won what has been called a brilliant"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1833","context":"victory, but it had not been a complete success. They had made"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1834","context":"an end of the German salient; and only the last defense of Lens"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1835","context":"remained. How much they had reduced the pressure on Russia is"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1836","context":"problematical; but there is little doubt they had prevented the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1837","context":"Germans from continuing the offensive on the Ypres front. They"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1838","context":"estimated the German loss at 60,000; and, by a peculiar coincidence,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1839","context":"the Crown Prince of Bavaria, whose armies they fought, estimated"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1840","context":"the French loss at the same figure--60,000. It is known they lost"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1841","context":"many men in the hand-to-hand struggles; but their great forward"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1842","context":"movement was so well protected by their artillery that the French"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1843","context":"loss there was comparatively slight. Some idea can be gained from"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1844","context":"the fact that one French division killed 2,600 of their enemy and"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1845","context":"captured 3,000 prisoners with a loss of only 250 slain and 1,250"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1846","context":"wounded. But the greatest gain to the French was probably the fact"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1847","context":"that the battle of the Artois had proved to the soldiers of the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1848","context":"republic that their artillery was the equal of the German, which"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1849","context":"had been the arm in which the Teutons excelled. It also proved"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1850","context":"that the Germans could not intrench themselves in any manner that"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1883","context":"made a desperate attack on the Germans on their front from La Bassée"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1884","context":"to Arras. The French and British had joined their efforts here,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1885","context":"not only to relieve the pressure which was being exerted on Ypres"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1886","context":"and to take Lille, which dominated a region rich in coal, but also"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1887","context":"for the purpose of keeping the Germans so busy on the western front"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1888","context":"that none could be sent to the eastern front and further embarrass"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1891","context":"against their foe. In this effort the British, using principally"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1892","context":"shrapnel, made little headway; but their ally, using high-explosive"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1893","context":"shells, such as they had been hurling at the Germans for weeks at"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1894","context":"the rate of a hundred thousand a day, was successful. Soon the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1895","context":"Teutons' front was screened by clouds of yellow, green, black and"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1896","context":"white smoke. But this was not to be a one-sided artillery engagement,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1897","context":"and the Germans soon had their artillery in action. They trained"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1898","context":"it on their enemies' trenches, believing from the size of the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1899","context":"bombardment that an assault was soon to be made and that the trenches"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1900","context":"would be filled with troops. Their surmise was correct, but the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1901","context":"Allies had suspected their opponents would reason thus, so the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1902","context":"French and British infantry were in covered positions. Of course"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1903","context":"the Germans did not know how well their opponents were protected,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1904","context":"so they sent thousands of shells against the allied positions."}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1911","context":"The bombardment was continued vigorously for three-quarters of an"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1930","context":"yards. At not a few sections the opposing trenches were near enough"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1931","context":"to permit the soldiers to converse with their opponents. The trenches"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1932","context":"for the most part were built on the marshland with sandbags, those"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1933","context":"of the British being khaki-colored, and the German being black and"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1934","context":"white. When the inevitable order to charge was given, the British"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1935","context":"artillery shifted its range to the German rear and the Eighth Division"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1936","context":"dashed over the black and white sandbags behind which the Germans"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1942","context":"started. Among the regiments that led the attack of the Eighth"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1943","context":"Division were the Kensington Battalion of the London Regiment,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1944","context":"the First Gloucesters, the Second Sussex, and the Northamptons."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1945","context":"They were supported by the Liverpool Territorials, the First North"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1946","context":"Lancashires, the Second King's Royal Rifles, and the Sussex"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1947","context":"Territorials. The Germans had large bodies of reenforcements held"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1948","context":"at Lille, but they were unavailing; and the British took the first"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1949","context":"line of trenches though it required fifteen and a half hours to do"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1950","context":"it. Then they went on until they were on the slope of the ridge."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1951","context":"Beyond that, however, it seemed impossible to proceed, for the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1952","context":"Germans had such an array of machine guns trained on the approach"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1953","context":"to their second line of trenches that no human being could live"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1954","context":"in the face of their deadly fire. The British needed an equipment"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1955","context":"with which to bombard their enemy with high-explosive shells. Such"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1956","context":"an equipment they did not possess."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1958","context":"The German commander played a clever trick on the British when"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1959","context":"their First Army Corps and their Indian Division attempted to make"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1960","context":"progress in the triangle to the west of La Bassée. He evacuated"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1961","context":"his first two lines of trenches while the artillery was doing what"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1962","context":"it could to demolish his parapets; but his men were drawn up in"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1963","context":"the third line of trenches waiting for the inevitable advance of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1964","context":"the British. This third line of trenches was protected with armor"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1965","context":"plate and concrete. Moreover he had planted a large number of machine"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1966","context":"guns in the brickfield near La Bassée. The British dashed forward"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1967","context":"until they were in range of the machine guns. Then they suffered"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1968","context":"such severe losses that they were forced to retreat, even though"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1969","context":"they had almost taken the inviting German trenches. The Highlanders"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1970","context":"and the Bedfords had made a gallant charge and felt especially"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1971","context":"humiliated to have to withdraw when victory was about to perch"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1972","context":"on their banners. They believed that a lack of reenforcements was"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1973","context":"responsible for their nonsuccess."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1975","context":"The day's fighting ended with the First Army of the British driven"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1976","context":"back except in the center. There the Kensington Territorial Battalion"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1977","context":"made a remarkable record for itself. In the morning when the British"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1978","context":"artillery ceased firing, the Kensington men dashed from their trenches"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1979","context":"and captured three lines of the German trenches at the point of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1980","context":"the bayonet. A part of the battalion, in its eagerness to win the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1981","context":"day, went on up the ridge. At the same time one of its companies"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1982","context":"turned to the left and another to the right, and with bayonet and"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1983","context":"bomb drove the Germans from the trenches for a distance of 200"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1984","context":"yards. The Kensingtons were doing the work that had been set for"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1985","context":"them to do; but two regular battalions, one to their left and the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1986","context":"other to their right, were not as able to comply with the orders"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1987","context":"they had received. The regulars were stopped by wire entanglements"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1988","context":"that the artillery had failed to smash, and, at the same time,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1989","context":"they were raked by machine-gun fire. Hence they were unable to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1990","context":"keep up with the Territorials. In fact the regulars never got up"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1991","context":"to the Kensington men; but were forced to retire. This left the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1992","context":"Territorials in a most precarious condition. They had gained such"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1993","context":"an important point on the German line that a heavy fire was directed"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1994","context":"against them. But the British would not give up what they had taken."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1995","context":"Instead of retiring, they sent for reenforcements which were promised"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1996","context":"to them. In the meantime the Germans gave up trying to blow the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1997","context":"Kensingtons out of their position and made a counterattack. The"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1998","context":"left wing of the plucky Territorial battalion used bombs effectively"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_1999","context":"to hold their enemy at bay. The right wing at the same time was"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2000","context":"kept busy in its attempt to prevent being enveloped. In spite of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2001","context":"all the Germans could do with their artillery and their repeated"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2002","context":"counterattacks the West London men maintained their small wedge in"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2003","context":"the Teuton front. Finally trench mortars were brought against them."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2004","context":"Then the Kensington battalion, or what was left of it, received the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2005","context":"order to retire. To do that necessitated fighting their way back"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2006","context":"through the thickening line of their enemy. Those British Territorials"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2007","context":"had held their peculiar position several hours, and had suffered"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2008","context":"severely in consequence; but their loss was undoubtedly much larger"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2009","context":"when retiring to their former line. They fought the greater part of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2010","context":"the afternoon and well into the evening in endeavoring to get back;"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2011","context":"and finally a comparatively few of them succeeded. The last dash to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2012","context":"the British trenches was made over a barren piece of ground which"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2013","context":"was so flat that there was no opportunity for concealment. And"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2014","context":"here the Germans raked what was left of the battalion with rifle"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2015","context":"and machine-gun fire. Ultimately, however, a portion of the brave"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2016","context":"band returned to the British trenches. Previous to withdrawing"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2017","context":"the survivors from the front, General Sir Henry Rawlinson told"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2018","context":"them that their gaining the position which they took and holding"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2019","context":"it as long as they did had not only relieved the pressure on Ypres"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2020","context":"but had aided General Foch's army to advance between Arras and La"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2021","context":"Bassée. In conclusion he said: \"It was a feat of arms surpassed"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2022","context":"by no battalion in this great war.\""}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2024","context":"The Sussex and Northampton troops made a desperate effort to get"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2025","context":"into the German trenches on the morning in which this action started,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2026","context":"but they never got nearer than forty yards, being stopped by the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2027","context":"deluge of shrapnel, rifle, and machine-gun fire to which they were"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2028","context":"subjected. When they were ordered to return to the British trenches,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2029","context":"those who remained able to make the attempt found it quite as dangerous"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2030","context":"as trying to go forward. That afternoon the Black Watch and the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2031","context":"First Cameronians charged where the Sussex and Northamptons had"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2032","context":"been repulsed, but the Scotchmen had but little more success. It"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2033","context":"is true some of the men from the land of the heather got into the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2034","context":"German trenches; but they did not survive. The determination of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2035","context":"the British was shown when men, who had been wounded in the first"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2036","context":"charge and been unable to return to their own line, joined the Scots"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2037","context":"in their mad rush to death. Those men had lain under fire twelve"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2038","context":"hours before making their dying assault on the German trenches."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2039","context":"It had been expected the Scotchmen would get into the opposing"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2040","context":"trenches and bomb and bayonet the Teutons out. Then reenforcements"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2041","context":"would be sent from the British line. But the artillery of King"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2042","context":"George was unable to check the devastating work of the kaiser's"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2043","context":"big guns and give the reenforcements a clear field through which"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2044","context":"to go to the aid of the attacking force. The result was that the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2045","context":"Germans continued such a leaden hail between the lines that it"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2046","context":"was sending soldiers to certain death to order them to cross the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2047","context":"zone of fire. The remnant of the Scottish regiments was recalled,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2048","context":"and it lost as many men on its return as it had in its desperate"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2049","context":"struggle to reach the German trenches."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2051","context":"Both the Kensingtons and the Scots found groups of German machine"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2052","context":"guns, doing most destructive work, that could have been rendered"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2053","context":"useless if the British had had a supply of high-explosive shells."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2054","context":"Under the circumstances there was nothing for Sir Douglas Haig to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2055","context":"do but to order his men all along the line to retire. They obeyed"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2056","context":"the order sullenly, and many of them were slain in their attempt to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2057","context":"get back to their own trenches. But their comrades felt they had"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2058","context":"not died wholly in vain; for the woeful lack of lyddite shells thus"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2059","context":"became known in England and the indignation thus aroused resulted"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2060","context":"in the appointment of a minister of munitions who organized the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2061","context":"manufacture of the necessary explosives on a scale heretofore"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2062","context":"unattempted by the British. A lesson had been learned, but at a"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2063","context":"fearful cost to life."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2065","context":"The same lesson was being taught the British public at another"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2066","context":"section of the battle front. Its soldiers not only were unable"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2067","context":"to maintain a successful artillery fire, but the fact became so"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2068","context":"impressed on the German mind that the Teutons in the Ypres and"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2069","context":"Lille regions felt assured that their infantry had the British"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2070","context":"at their mercy. Sir John French, however, had a clever knowledge"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2071","context":"of human nature. He began his efforts to remedy the difficulty"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2072","context":"by telling the war correspondents his troubles. They spread the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2073","context":"news. Then he secretly collected all of the available artillery"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2074","context":"in the Ypres region, together with his limited supply of shells,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2075","context":"and was ready to deal such a blow to the Duke of Württemberg's"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2076","context":"army when it marched on Ypres the latter part of May, 1915, that"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2077","context":"it was necessary for the Germans to get reenforcements through"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2088","context":"The operation of this plan of Sir John French had an excellent"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2089","context":"effect in the Ypres region, but it had the opposite effect on the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2090","context":"British who were trying to take Lille. Moreover it was necessary"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2091","context":"for the British to continue to occupy the attention of the left"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2092","context":"wing of the German army, under the command of the Crown Prince of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2093","context":"Bavaria, in order to keep him from using his men against General"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2094","context":"Foch, who was attempting to push his way between Arras and Lille."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2095","context":"Inasmuch as the British artillery had proved ineffective because"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2096","context":"of its lack of enough and the proper kind of ammunition, Sir John"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2097","context":"French planned another surprise for the Germans. This time he selected"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2098","context":"the weapon which the Teutons seemed most to fear when it was in the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2099","context":"hands of the British--the bayonet. The salient on the German front"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2100","context":"at Festubert, between La Bassée and Neuve Chapelle, was chosen for"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2101","context":"the proposed military feat. The territory occupied by the Teutons"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2102","context":"had the appearance, to the casual observer, of being lowlands on"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2103","context":"which were wrecked homes, farms, and trees. The actual conditions"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2104","context":"of this section of the country were much more serious for any body"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2105","context":"of troops which planned to make an attack. The ground was moist"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2106","context":"and muddy, in many places being crossed by treacherous ditches"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2107","context":"filled with slimy water. Moreover the exact range of practically"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2108","context":"every square foot of it was known to the German artillerymen, whose"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2109","context":"guns were on the high ground to the west of the lowlands. The British"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2110","context":"were in trenches from seventy to three hundred yards from those of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2111","context":"their enemy. If the men there could dash across the intervening"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2112","context":"space and get into the German trenches before being annihilated"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2113","context":"by the kaiser's cannon, they would use the bayonet with deadly"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2114","context":"effect, and, from past experiences, have reasonable hope of gaining"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2115","context":"a victory. It was decided to make such an attempt first on that"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2116","context":"part of the line between Richebourg on the left and Festubert on"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2117","context":"the right."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2119","context":"The British Seventh Division was sent south to support the attack"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2120","context":"which was to have been made on May 12, 1915. On that day it was"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2121","context":"too foggy for the aviators to see with any degree of accuracy; so"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2122","context":"the movement was delayed. This gave time for the Canadian Division"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2123","context":"to be sent south and add their strength to the support. The German"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2124","context":"trenches, at this point where the attack was to be made, were occupied"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2125","context":"by the Seventh Westphalian Army Corps. This corps had lost many of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2126","context":"its men at Neuve Chapelle; and their places had been taken by youths"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2127","context":"who had not reached the development of manhood and whose immaturity"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2128","context":"and lack of military training greatly lessened the efficiency of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2129","context":"this famous body of troops."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2131","context":"Finally, on Saturday night, May 15, 1915, all conditions for the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2132","context":"attack seemed favorable to the British. There was no moon and the sky"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2133","context":"was dark, though there was not that inky blackness that occasionally"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2134","context":"occurs under similar weather conditions. The Indian Corps stole from"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2135","context":"their trenches and began to go forward from Richebourg l'Avoué."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2136","context":"But the Germans were alert, and they illumined the movement with"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2137","context":"innumerable flares which made the Indians easy targets for the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2138","context":"machine guns and rifles of the Teutons in that part of the line."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2139","context":"So quick was the work to repel the attack that many of the Indians"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2140","context":"were slain as they were climbing out of their own trenches. As"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2141","context":"a surprise attack at night, the British were not making much of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2142","context":"a success of their plan, but as a method of gaining ground and"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2143","context":"keeping their enemy busy on that particular part of the line the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2144","context":"men of their Second Division were effective. They dashed into the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2145","context":"first line of German trenches and cleared them out with the bayonet"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2146","context":"and hand grenade. The furor of the attack took them on into the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2147","context":"second line. By dawn the soldiers of the Second Division had driven"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2148","context":"a wedge into the German line."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2150","context":"This wedge was widened and driven in harder by Sir Douglas Haig's"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2151","context":"old command--the First Corps. This corps had suffered heavy losses"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2152","context":"at the first battle of Ypres; but the men who filled the gaps in"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2153","context":"the line were hardy young men who made excellent soldiers from"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2154","context":"the start. Added to their enthusiasm was a desire to show their"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2155","context":"ability as fighters, with the result that the British right wing was"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2156","context":"so effective that it, in a great measure, made up for the failure of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2157","context":"the Indian troops. The center and the right, with bomb and bayonet,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2158","context":"drove the Germans from the trenches; and then together they forced"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2159","context":"their way into the Teutons' position 600 yards along a front 800"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2160","context":"yards in length. Early the next morning, before daylight on May"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2161","context":"16, 1915, the British Seventh Division forced its way into the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2162","context":"German salient at Festubert. In the meantime the Germans were making"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2163","context":"hasty preparations for a counterattack. Sir John French's plan,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2164","context":"however, had proved effective. It would have required a large supply"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2165","context":"of high-explosive shells to have made much of an impression on the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2166","context":"excellent defenses which the German soldiers had constructed on"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2167","context":"this part of the front. The British had no such supply of ammunition,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2168","context":"and, even if they had had it, it is doubtful if they would have been"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2276","context":"on in spite of the fact that the nature of the country was such"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2277","context":"that they were wet through and covered with mud. It was not all"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2278","context":"enthusiasm, however. Mingled with the desire for victory was a desire"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2279","context":"for revenge. The British on this part of the line were enraged by"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2280","context":"the use of gas at Ypres and the sinking of the _Lusitania_."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2282","context":"On the night of May 17, 1915, the Fourth Cameron Highlanders, a"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2283","context":"Territorial battalion, met with disaster. The men composing this"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2284","context":"unit were from Inverness-shire, Skye, and the Outer Islands. Many"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2285","context":"of them had been gamekeepers and hence were accustomed to outdoor"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2286","context":"life and the handling of guns, all of which aided them in saving"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2287","context":"the remnant of their command. They had been ordered to take some"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2289","context":"The Cameronians on the way to the attack fell into a ditch which"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2290","context":"was both deep and wide. It was necessary for them to swim to get"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2292","context":"being slain by German shells and the rifle fire that the men in"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2293","context":"the cottages rained upon the Scots. One company was annihilated."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2294","context":"Another company lost its way. The rear end of a German communicating"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2295","context":"trench was reached by a third company. Long before midnight this"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2296","context":"company was almost without ammunition. Two platoons reenforced it"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2297","context":"at midnight; but the reenforcements had no machine guns, which"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2298","context":"would have given at least temporary relief. Under the circumstances"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2299","context":"the only thing for the Territorials to do was to retreat. The Germans"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2300","context":"made that quite as perilous a venture as the advance had been."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2301","context":"Only half of those who started for the cottages returned. Among"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2306","context":"of the Festubert-La Quinque Rue road; and took a defense 300 yards"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2307","context":"to the southeast of the hamlet. Two farms west of the road and"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2309","context":"Cour de l'Avoué, in front of which latter the surrendering Saxons"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2310","context":"were slain, had been held by the Germans with numerous machine guns."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2311","context":"The British took both farms by nightfall and found, on counting"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2312","context":"their prisoners, that they then had a total of 608 as well as several"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2313","context":"machine guns."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2315","context":"The Second and Seventh Divisions were withdrawn by Sir Douglas"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2316","context":"Haig on the following day, Wednesday, May 19, 1915. The Fifty-first"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2317","context":"Division and the Canadians took the places of the men who were sadly"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2318","context":"in need of relief from active duty. Lieutenant General Alderson"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2319","context":"received the command of both divisions together with the artillery"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2320","context":"of both the Second and Seventh Divisions. The cold, wet weather"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2321","context":"hampered operations and there was comparatively little activity,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2322","context":"though hostilities by no means altogether ceased. Each side needed"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2323","context":"a little rest and time to fill in gaps in their respective lines."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2324","context":"Hence it was not until Sunday, May 23, that any fighting on a large"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2325","context":"scale took place. On that day the Seventh Prussian Army Corps made"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2326","context":"a desperate effort to break through that part of the British line"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2327","context":"held by the Canadians near Festubert. The Prussians used their"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2328","context":"old tactics with the result that the British shrapnel, rifle, and"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2329","context":"machine-gun fire plowed great holes in their ranks. The Teutons in"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2330","context":"this instance were without adequate artillery support, for many"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2331","context":"of their batteries had been made useless by the British. From then"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2332","context":"on to May 25, 1915, there were several small engagements in which"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2333","context":"the British made gains. Then Sir John French concluded to end the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2334","context":"activity of his men on this part of the front. In that connection"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2335","context":"he made the following statement: \"I had now reasons to consider"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2336","context":"that the battle which was commenced by the First Army on May 9 and"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2337","context":"renewed on the 16th, having attained for the moment the immediate"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2338","context":"object I had in view, should not be further actively proceeded"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2341","context":"\"In the battle of Festubert the enemy was driven from a position"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2342","context":"which was strongly intrenched and fortified, and ground was won"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2343","context":"on a front of four miles to an average depth of 600 yards.\""}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2346","context":"       *       *       *       *       *"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2350","context":"ATTACKS AT LA BASSÉE"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2352","context":"The British had discovered the futility of attempting to smash through"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2353","context":"the German lines without an adequate supply of high-explosive shells"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2354","context":"with which to destroy the heavy wire entanglements. Moreover, in"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2355","context":"maintaining a curtain of fire between the German lines and potential"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2356","context":"reenforcements, it was necessary to increase the artillery arm"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2357","context":"of the service. At this time the Germans could fire four shells"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2358","context":"to one by the British. Another very essential equipment in which"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2359","context":"the British were lacking was machine guns. The German army had"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2360","context":"developed machine-gun warfare apparently to its highest power."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2361","context":"They not only used it to increase their volume of fire, but also"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2362","context":"as a means of saving their infantry. When, for any reason, it was"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2363","context":"found expedient to move infantry, a few machine-gun crews would"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2364","context":"take the place of the soldiers with the rifle and maintain a fire"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2365","context":"which would be almost as effective in checking the British advance"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2366","context":"as the infantry had been. The British had no such number of machine"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2367","context":"guns. They lacked this necessary part of their equipment just as"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2368","context":"they lacked shells, cannon, aircraft, and other war material which"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2369","context":"the Germans had developed and accumulated in large quantities under"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2370","context":"the supervision of the German General Staff."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2372","context":"The German munition factories had been making and storing enormous"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2373","context":"supplies for an army of several millions of men. On the other hand"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2374","context":"the British had believed in the excellence of their comparatively"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2375","context":"small army to such an extent that it required all of the fighting"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2376","context":"from the time their troops landed on the Continent up to Festubert"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2377","context":"to convince them that they must make and maintain a military machine"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2378","context":"at least equal, if not superior, to the one her foes possessed."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2379","context":"It is true the British needed more men in the ranks, but what was"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2380","context":"needed more was large additions to the supply of machine guns,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2381","context":"artillery, and ammunition."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2383","context":"For those reasons the British generals avoided clashes with the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2384","context":"Germans after the battle of Festubert, except when it was necessary"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2385","context":"to hold as many of the Germans as possible to the British part of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2386","context":"the western front. This plan was maintained throughout the summer"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2387","context":"of 1915. In the meantime the Germans were constructing, beyond"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2388","context":"their trenches, the most elaborate series of field fortifications"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2389","context":"in the history of warfare. The German staff realized that the time"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2390","context":"was coming when the British would again take the offensive. When"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2391","context":"that time arrived the Germans would thus be prepared to make every"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2392","context":"foot of ground gained as costly as possible to their foes. In fact"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2393","context":"they had reason for believing that it would be almost impossible for"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2394","context":"their opponents to gain ground where it was held by such seemingly"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2395","context":"impregnable works."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2397","context":"An attack at La Bassée in the first weeks in June, 1915, started"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2398","context":"with the British Second Army making a pretended advance in the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2399","context":"Ypres region. The British in the forest of Ploegsteert drove a"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2400","context":"mine into the German lines and blew it up. The explosion followed"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2401","context":"by a British charge, which resulted in the taking of a part of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2402","context":"the German trenches. This forest extended northwest of Lille and"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2403","context":"south of Messines. Under the ground in this section the sappers"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2404","context":"had built a city, whose streets were named for the thoroughfare"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2405","context":"of London. Thus there was \"Regent Street,\" \"Piccadilly Circus,\""}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2406","context":"\"Leicester Square,\" and many others. There was also a \"Kensington"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2407","context":"Garden,\" in which grew wild flowers transplanted from the forest"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2408","context":"by the soldiers."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2410","context":"The Germans had been driven out of the forest in the fall of 1914"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2411","context":"when they made their dash to reach Calais; but their trenches were"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2412","context":"only about 400 yards beyond the eastern edge. The earth here was"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2413","context":"especially adaptable for mines, and both sides made many attempts"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2414","context":"to work destruction by tunneling forward. In this activity it was"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2415","context":"soon found necessary to have men in advanced positions in the tunnels"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2416","context":"to listen to the mining operations of their opponents. As soon as"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2417","context":"such operations were discovered, a countertunnel was driven in"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2418","context":"that direction and a mine exploded, thereby destroying the enemy's"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2419","context":"tunnel and burying his sappers. Sometimes, however, the men in the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2420","context":"countertunnel cut through to the other excavation and engaged in"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2421","context":"a hand-to-hand conflict beneath the surface of the earth. Then"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2422","context":"primitive methods were used. Though mining had taken place on other"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2423","context":"sections of the western front, as at Hill 60, it was in this forest"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2424","context":"area that it was probably brought to its highest development."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2426","context":"The British mine here, as noted above, on June 6, 1915, blew up"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2427","context":"the German trenches, and the British charged into the crater and"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2428","context":"drove the Germans out with bayonet and bomb. A similar crater was"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2429","context":"the result of the mining at La Bassée. Five mines at the end of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2430","context":"tunnels constructed by the Germans did not go far enough toward"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2431","context":"the British trenches, and when the explosions occurred the trenches"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2432","context":"remained intact."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2434","context":"The sappers, however, had other things to contend with; this was"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2435","context":"the case when a tunnel was driven toward the German trenches between"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2436","context":"Rue du Bois and Rue d'Ouvert, near the La Bassée Canal. Water was"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2437","context":"found below the German intrenchments. The British managed to keep"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2438","context":"the water out of the tunnel by using sandbags. Then they planted"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2439","context":"enough dynamite to blow up a large part of the German force. The"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2440","context":"two trench lines were very close together on this part of the front;"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2441","context":"and, to prevent accidents, the British left their trenches near"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2442","context":"the mine before it was fired."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2444","context":"On the night of June 6, 1915, the mine tore open the trenches of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2445","context":"both sides, and buried one of the British magazines which was filled"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2446","context":"with hand grenades and killed several British bomb throwers. At about"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2447","context":"the same moment another supply of British bombs was exploded when"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2448","context":"it was struck by a shell from a German howitzer. This occurred at"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2449","context":"a place on the line called Duck's Bill, and resulted in the British"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2450","context":"being without an adequate supply of hand grenades. The British troops"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2451","context":"in this action were the soldiers of a British division and a Canadian"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2452","context":"brigade. The latter included the First Ontario Regiment, the Second"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2453","context":"and Fourth Canadian Battalions, the Third Toronto Regiment, and"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2454","context":"the East Yorkshires."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2456","context":"The Ontario regiment was directed against a fortified part of the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2457","context":"German line which was called Stony Mountain. To the south of Stony"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2458","context":"Mountain, about 150 yards, was another fortified position called"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2459","context":"Dorchester. This also was to be taken by the Ontario men. If they"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2460","context":"succeeded in their work the right flank of the British division"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2461","context":"would be protected. But it was Stony Mountain that was of most"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2462","context":"importance to the British. Its machine guns and its northern defenses"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2463","context":"menaced the route which the British must take to make an advance. In"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2464","context":"order to prevent the Germans from giving their undivided attention"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2465","context":"to the Canadians, the British division on the left made an advance"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2466","context":"against the Teutons north of Stony Mountain. The British artillery"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2467","context":"had been shelling this part of the German line day and night many"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2469","context":"into the brick fields near La Bassée, and in front of the wrecked"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2470","context":"village of Quinchy."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2472","context":"The German machine-gun crews were hidden behind the brick stacks"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2473","context":"which were square blocks of burned clay upon which the British"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2474","context":"shells burst without perceptible effect. The shells that went over"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2475","context":"the stacks, however, did much damage. Beyond the brick field to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2476","context":"the north were the ruins of farm buildings which were also hiding"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2477","context":"places for the Germans and their machine guns. All the buildings"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2478","context":"back of the German line had been turned into fortresses whose"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2479","context":"underground works were concreted and connected with their headquarters"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2480","context":"by telephone. While the British artillery was attempting to destroy"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2481","context":"these fortresses it was also hurling lyddite shells into the trenches."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2483","context":"The German artillery fire greatly exceeded the British in volume."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2484","context":"Nevertheless the British forces were in the more comfortable position."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2485","context":"They had comparatively little to do except wait until they were needed,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2486","context":"which would be when their artillery had completed the preparation"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2487","context":"for the inevitable charge. On the other hand the German soldier"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2488","context":"had a nerve-racking part to play. He knew from the preparation"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2489","context":"that an attack in force was about to be made; but he did not know"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2490","context":"when it would occur nor where. Hence it was necessary for him to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2491","context":"be constantly on the alert. Many of the Germans were under arms"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2492","context":"at all hours of the day and night. In fact few of them on that"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2493","context":"part of their line got any real rest during the week in which the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2494","context":"bombardment continued. The section between the two lines of trenches"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2495","context":"was illuminated at night, and the cannonade kept up so that there"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2496","context":"was no opportunity for the Germans to repair the havoc made by"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2497","context":"the British shells."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2499","context":"The suspense was terminated on the evening of June 15, 1915, by"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2500","context":"an additional flight of projectiles from the British guns. Every"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2501","context":"piece of British ordnance on that part of the line was worked at"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2502","context":"top speed. The Germans, knowing that this immediately preceded an"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2503","context":"infantry charge, used their artillery to stop it. But the British"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2504","context":"charge formed in their trenches, with the Canadians on their right."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2505","context":"In addition to the shrapnel the Germans made breaks in the lines of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2506","context":"their foes by the use of machine guns, but the breaks were quickly"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2507","context":"filled. On some parts of the front the British and Canadians were"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2508","context":"successful and reached the trenches. In all the captured trenches"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2509","context":"extended from Rue du Bois to Rue d'Ouvert."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2511","context":"In the meantime those Canadians who had been directed against Stony"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2512","context":"Mountain and Dorchester were doing heroic work. The First Company"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2513","context":"of the Ontario Regiment charged through the débris of the mine"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2514","context":"explosion, only to run into the deadly hail sent at them by the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2515","context":"machine guns. But the Canadians were determined to complete their"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2516","context":"task, and they took Dorchester and the connecting trench. The fire"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2517","context":"was too heavy for them to reach Stony Mountain. A group of bombers"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2518","context":"made a dash forward, but were shot down before they could get near"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2519","context":"enough to use their weapons."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2521","context":"The second and third companies rushed forward, suffering severely"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2522","context":"from the deluge of lead, but some of their men got into the German"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2523","context":"second line and then began to bomb their way to right and left. The"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2524","context":"captured first trench was utilized by the attacking force. From"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2525","context":"that vantage the advance was led by a machine gun which was followed"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2526","context":"by a group of bomb throwers. In working forward the machine-gun"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2527","context":"base became lost when the man who had it was slain. Thereupon a"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2528","context":"Canadian \"lumberjack\" named Vincent became the base, the machine"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2529","context":"gun being fired from his back. But the German bomb throwers drove"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2530","context":"the attacking force out of the trench. The Germans kept a rain"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2531","context":"of lead between the Canadians and the British line of trenches"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2532","context":"with the result that it was almost suicide for a man to attempt"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2533","context":"to return for bombs. Nevertheless many braved the ordeal. Only"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2534","context":"one was successful. He, Private Smith of Southampton, Ontario,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2535","context":"seemed to bear a charmed life, for he made the trip five times."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2536","context":"The Third Canadian Battalion was sent forward to reenforce the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2537","context":"Ontario Regiment which had lost most of its officers, but such a"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2538","context":"pressure of German forces were brought to bear on the Canadians"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2539","context":"that the reenforcements were unavailing, and the Canadians were"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2540","context":"forced to relinquish all they had gained, and return to their own"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2541","context":"trenches that night."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2543","context":"The retreat was a desperate undertaking; the Germans then had the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2544","context":"Canadians in the open and added heavily to the Canadian's death"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2545","context":"roll. On the other side of Stony Mountain the British had met with"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2546","context":"no better success than the Canadians. Having started their enemies"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2547","context":"back, the Germans massed for a counterattack and drove them back"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2548","context":"a mile, but not without a terrific struggle. The battle field was"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2549","context":"lighted by the peculiar fireworks used for such purposes and bursting"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2550","context":"of shells. Jets of flame shot forth from machine guns and rifles."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2551","context":"In many places the intermittent light disclosed deadly hand-to-hand"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2552","context":"conflicts. Suddenly the Germans concentrated their fire on a portion"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2553","context":"of their lost first line of trenches, and the trenches of their"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2554","context":"enemies who held them were no more. Having the British and Canadians"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2555","context":"defeated, as they believed, the Germans proceeded to add to their"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2556","context":"victory by storming the British and Canadian trenches. They met"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2557","context":"with resistance, however, that drove them back."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2559","context":"At daybreak on June 16, 1915, the artillery on both sides resumed"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2560","context":"firing on a large scale. Suddenly, in the afternoon, the British"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2561","context":"fire increased preparatory to another charge. This time the British"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2562","context":"commander had selected a smaller section for his attack. This was"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2563","context":"at Rue d'Ouvert, and the men who had been selected to make the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2564","context":"charge were the Territorials and the Liverpool Irish. They got"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2565","context":"into the first line of German trenches which the Teutons shelled"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2566","context":"to such an extent that the remnant of the attacking force had to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2567","context":"retreat. Then the Second Gordon Highlanders and other Scotch soldiers"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2568","context":"made a gallant charge at the same place, Rue d'Ouvert, on June 18,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2569","context":"1915, but were forced to retire to their own trenches."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2571","context":"These attacks on this part of the German front resulted in repulses"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2572","context":"for those who made them; but, at the same time, they helped the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2573","context":"Allies win victories elsewhere by keeping the German troops on"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2574","context":"that part of the line from going to reenforce those who were being"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2575","context":"hard pressed by the French. In this manner the British and Canadians,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2576","context":"who fought so valiantly and with so little apparent success at"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2577","context":"Stony Mountain and Rue d'Ouvert, were in a measure responsible"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2578","context":"for the French victories at Angres, Souchez, and the Labyrinth."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2579","context":"The Crown Prince of Bavaria could not hold out against both the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2580","context":"French and British, but he believed it was more important for him"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2581","context":"to check the British, because a victory for them would threaten"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2589","context":"OPERATIONS AROUND HOOGE"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2591","context":"The next action of importance on the British front occurred at"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2592","context":"the Château of Hooge on the Menin road about three miles east of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2593","context":"Ypres. Here had been the headquarters of Sir John French and Sir"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2594","context":"Douglas Haig at the first battle of Ypres. From the Château Sir"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2595","context":"John French had seen the British line break at Gheluvelt, thereby"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2596","context":"opening the road for the Germans to Calais. That opening, however,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2597","context":"had been closed by the Worchsters. After the Germans began to use"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2598","context":"their deadly gas in the spring of 1915 they again took possession"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2599","context":"of Hooge, and used the Menin road for a forward movement which"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2600","context":"threatened what was left of Ypres."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2602","context":"The Duke of Württemberg was in command of that part of the line"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2603","context":"opposed to the British, and his forces extended from near Pilkem in"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2604","context":"the north to near Hill 60 in the south, in the form of a crescent."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2605","context":"He made use of the asphyxiating gas cloud and gas bombs so frequently"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2606","context":"on this part of the front that the British soldiers became expert in"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2607","context":"donning their hood like masks and in using respirators. Moreover,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2608","context":"the British were constantly on the alert for the appearance of the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2609","context":"poison gas. So that this method of attack was much less effective."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2610","context":"Before the Germans discovered how well the British had prepared"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2611","context":"themselves against the gas, they met with disaster twice when using"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2612","context":"it. On both occasions they had followed their gas cloud expecting"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2613","context":"to find their foes writhing on the ground in choking agony--an"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2614","context":"easy prey for an attack."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2616","context":"But the British had put on their curious-appearing headgear, and"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2617","context":"were waiting for the men whom they knew would be following the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2618","context":"cloud at a safe distance. As soon as the Germans were near enough"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2619","context":"the British turned loose everything that would hurl a projectile"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2620","context":"large or small. By the time the gas cloud had cleared, or, to be"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2621","context":"more accurate, passed on to the rear of the British line and spent"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2622","context":"itself, the only Germans to be seen were in the piles of dead and"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2623","context":"wounded in front of the British most advanced trenches. The first"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2624","context":"time this occurred did not teach the Germans its lesson sufficiently"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2625","context":"well. A second time the Germans did not follow their gas cloud so"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2626","context":"closely. The gas-filled shells, however, the British found more"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2627","context":"difficult. They did not give warning of their coming as did the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2628","context":"appearance of the comparatively slow-moving gas cloud. Thus in"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2629","context":"the first week of May, 1915, Hill 60 was taken by the Germans in"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2630","context":"a bombardment of asphyxiating shells. The bombardment had been"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2631","context":"immediately followed by a charge of bomb throwers who made an assault"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2632","context":"on the hill from three sides at once. That forced the British to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2633","context":"retreat to a trench line at the foot of the hill, and gave the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2634","context":"top of the hill to the Germans who immediately set up a lookout"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2635","context":"post for their artillery back of the Zandvoord ridge."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2637","context":"This part of the British line was under the command of Sir Herbert"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2638","context":"Plumer. His troops occupied themselves from the first week in May"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2639","context":"to the middle of August, 1915, in fighting in the Hooge district."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2640","context":"Most of this fighting was important only because it kept the Germans"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2641","context":"busy on that section of the line, and prevented them from being"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2642","context":"able to reenforce the Crown Prince of Bavaria or adding men to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2643","context":"the force that was driving the Russians eastward."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2645","context":"The men, fresh from the training camps, fought alongside of hardened"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2646","context":"veterans and learned much from them. From being what amounted to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2647","context":"auxiliaries in these actions the new troops became hardened to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2648","context":"actual fighting conditions. For this reason the personnel of the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2649","context":"British troops on this part of the line was changed frequently."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2650","context":"This was especially true at Hooge. Princess Patricia's Canadian"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2651","context":"Regiment occupied the Château and village of Hooge on May 8, 1915."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2652","context":"The \"Princess Pats,\" as they were known at home, turned over their"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2653","context":"quarters to the Ninth Lancers who were followed by the Fifteenth"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2654","context":"Hussars and the Second Camerons."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2656","context":"On May 24, 1915, the Germans made a great gas attack. They had"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2657","context":"placed along the line from St. Julien to Hooge a great number of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2658","context":"gas tanks. They then started a bombardment with asphyxiating shells."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2659","context":"When the bombardment was well under way the tanks were opened."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2660","context":"The ensuing cloud was five miles long and forty feet high; and"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2661","context":"it floated over the British trenches from 3 a. m. to 7 a. m. The"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2662","context":"cloud was followed by three columns of infantry, who dashed forward"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2663","context":"under the protection of the shells of their artillery. But the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2664","context":"Germans made gains in only two places--at Hooge and to the north of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2665","context":"Wieltje. For the most part the British regained by counterattacks"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2666","context":"what they lost; but they were unable to retake the Château of Hooge,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2667","context":"though the Ninth Lancers and the Fifteenth Hussars made a heroic"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2668","context":"attempt to regain it. Thereupon the Third Dragoons received orders"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2669","context":"to attempt to retake the Château of Hooge. They went into the second"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2670","context":"line of the British trenches to the south of the Menin road on May"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2671","context":"29, 1915. The Germans bombarded the trenches with high-explosive"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2672","context":"shells while from the German trenches a torrent of small arms fire"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2673","context":"poured. In spite of the continued hail of lead, the Dragoons held"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2674","context":"to their position though their trenches were wrecked."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2676","context":"Early in the morning of May 31, the British charged and drove their"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2677","context":"enemy from the ruins of the Château and its stables. The Germans"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2678","context":"turned all of their artillery on that part of the line against"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2679","context":"Hooge, and when the bombardment was finished there was only a heap"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2680","context":"of ruins left. The British withdrew from the Château, but only"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2681","context":"for a short distance."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2683","context":"The bombardment was renewed on June 1; on that day the German infantry"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2684","context":"tried to dislodge the Dragoons, but the attempt was unsuccessful."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2685","context":"Again, on June 2, the artillery was used, the German shells being"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2686","context":"hurled a part of the time at the rate of twenty a minute. Under the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2687","context":"cover of this terrific bombardment a part of the German infantry"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2688","context":"charged from the Bellewaarde Lake region. They got to the Château"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2689","context":"before a British battery opened fire on them. Again they entered"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2690","context":"the ruins and made a dash out on the opposite side, where they were"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2691","context":"met by more machine-gun fire. Three times they tried to escape,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2692","context":"but practically all of them were slain. Other attempts were made"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2693","context":"by the Germans that afternoon, but none of them was successful."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2695","context":"The Dragoons were relieved on June 3, 1915, and their places were"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2696","context":"taken by a much larger force. It included the Third Worcesters,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2697","context":"the First Wiltshires, the First Northumberland Fusiliers, the First"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2698","context":"Lincolnshires, the Royal Fusiliers, the Royal Scots Fusiliers,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2699","context":"and the Liverpool Scottish, a territorial organization."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2701","context":"The British artillery was concentrated in the neighborhood of Hooge"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2702","context":"and started a bombardment on June 16. After a fairly adequate"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2703","context":"preparation by cannonade, the infantry charged the German line for"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2704","context":"a thousand yards near the Château, and took a part of the second"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2705","context":"line of trenches. Again the British bayonet and bomb had won, though"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2706","context":"in this attack the greater credit must be given to the bomb. The"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2707","context":"Germans made an attempt to retrieve the day by battering the British"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2708","context":"out of the trenches they had won. To do this the German artillery"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2709","context":"used a plentiful supply of high-explosive shells. They continued"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2710","context":"the attempt for twenty-four hours; but all they succeeded in doing"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2711","context":"was driving the British back to the first line of German trenches"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2712","context":"where they waited for the inevitable attack of the infantry which"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2713","context":"was repulsed. Finally the Germans seemed inclined to give up trying"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2714","context":"to accomplish much on this part of their front."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2716","context":"In the first week of July, 1915, the British took two hundred yards"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2717","context":"of German trenches, eighty prisoners and three trench mortars."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2718","context":"The German commander now turned once more to Hooge. An additional"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2719","context":"reason for his renewed interest in that place was the fact that the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2720","context":"British engineers, on July 20, blew up a mine west of the Château,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2721","context":"thereby making a great crater in which the British infantry made"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2722","context":"themselves comparatively secure. The crater was one hundred and"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2723","context":"fifty feet wide and fifty feet deep."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2725","context":"The Germans made an unsuccessful attempt to take the crater on"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2726","context":"July 21, 1915; and tried again on July 24. The Duke of Württemberg"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2727","context":"found his men making comparatively little progress. It is true that"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2728","context":"the British had not made much more. The gas attacks had gained ground"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2729","context":"before the British had learned how to avoid the more severe effects"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2730","context":"of the poison. The result of experience brought into existence"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2731","context":"a new device. It has been called a flame projector, and has been"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2732","context":"described as a portable tank which is filled with a highly inflammable"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2733","context":"coal-tar product. The contents of the tank were pumped through a"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2734","context":"nozzle at the end of which was a lighting arrangement. The flame"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_2735","context":"could be thrown approximately forty yards."}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_3165","context":"mine under the fort at the peak of the salient blew up. The Germans"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_3166","context":"who sought refuge in their dugouts found them unavailing. The shells"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_3167","context":"had blown the roofs from those places of supposed safety. In many"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_3185","context":"shells accounted for them before the reserves ever reached those"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_3211","context":"advance along the lines of the communicating trenches. They were"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_3212","context":"greeted with a shower of hand grenades. By nightfall the Germans"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_3213","context":"seemed to have wearied of the attacks. The total German loss in"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_3222","context":"the offensive in the region of La Fontenelle, in the Ban-de-Sapt,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_3223","context":"in April and June. The French engineers had built a redoubt to the"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_3225","context":"not take it by an assault; so their sappers went to work to tunnel"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_3226","context":"under it; but they had to bore through very hard rock and the work"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_3227","context":"was necessarily slow. The French, learning of the mining operations"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_3228","context":"of their foes, started a countereffort with the result that there"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_3229","context":"was a succession of fierce skirmishes under the surface of the"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_3234","context":"tried to rally their men for further operations, but their soldiers"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_3248","context":"On the night of July 8 the French began a bombardment which was"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_3251","context":"in spite of its corrugated iron and gun-shield defenses to which"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4439","context":"As it passed I had my men line up on deck, and gave a greeting."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4440","context":"The greeting was answered. Then, before the harbor at Padang, I"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4469","context":"steamers boats could come alongside and talk with us. Finally, we"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4470","context":"were allowed to have German papers. They were, to be sure, from"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4477","context":"they were Hollanders and didn't do anything to us. Then for two"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4478","context":"weeks more we drifted around, lying still for days. The weather was"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4480","context":"came in sight. It saw us and made a big curve around us. I made"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4481","context":"everything hastily 'clear for battle.' Then one of our officers"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4482","context":"recognized her for the _Choising_. She showed the German flag. I"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4483","context":"sent up light rockets, although it was broad day, and went with"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4484","context":"all sails set, that were still setable, toward her. The _Choising_"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4485","context":"was a coaster from Hongkong to Siam. She was at Singapore when"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4486","context":"the war broke out, then went to Batavia, was chartered, loaded"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4487","context":"with coal for the enemy, and had put into Padang in need, because"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4491","context":"for review. The fellows hadn't a rag on. Thus, in nature's garb,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4492","context":"we gave three cheers for the German flag on the _Choising_. The"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4493","context":"men of the _Choising_ told us afterward 'We couldn't make out what"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4494","context":"that meant, those stark-naked fellows all cheering.' The sea was"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4495","context":"too high, and we had to wait two days before we could board the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4496","context":"_Choising_ on December 16, 1914. We took very little with us; the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4497","context":"schooner was taken in tow. In the afternoon we sank the _Ayesha_ and"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4498","context":"were all very sad. The good old _Ayesha_ had served us faithfully"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4499","context":"for six weeks. The log showed that we had made 1,709 sea miles"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4500","context":"under sail since leaving Keeling. She wasn't at all rotten and"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4501","context":"unseaworthy, as they had told me, but nice and white and dry inside."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4502","context":"I had grown fond of the boat, on which I could practice my old"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4503","context":"sailing maneuvers. The only trouble was that the sails would go"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4504","context":"to pieces every now and then, because they were so old."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4506","context":"\"But anyway, she went down quite properly. We had bored a hole"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4507","context":"in her; she filled slowly and then all of a sudden disappeared."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4508","context":"That was the saddest day of the whole month. We gave her three"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4509","context":"cheers, and my next yacht at Kiel will be named _Ayesha_, that is"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4512","context":"\"To the captain of the _Choising_ I had said, when I hailed him,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4513","context":"'I do not know what will happen to the ship. The war situation"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4514","context":"may make it necessary for me to strand it.' He did not want to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4515","context":"undertake the responsibility. I proposed that we work together,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4516","context":"and I would take the responsibility. Then we traveled together"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4517","context":"for three weeks, from Padang to Hodeida. The _Choising_ was some"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4518","context":"ninety meters long, and had a speed of nine miles, though sometimes"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4519","context":"only four. If she had not accidentally arrived I had intended to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4520","context":"cruise along the west coast of Sumatra to the region of the northern"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4521","context":"monsoon. I came about six degrees north, then over toward Aden"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4522","context":"to the Arabian coast. In the Red Sea the northeastern monsoon,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4523","context":"which here blows southeast, could bring us to Djidda. I had heard"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4524","context":"in Padang that Turkey was still allied with Germany, so we would"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4525","context":"be able to get safely through Arabia to Germany."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4527","context":"\"I next waited for information through ships, but the _Choising_"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4528","context":"did not know anything definite, either. By way of the _Luchs_, the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4529","context":"_Königsberg_ and _Kormoran_ the reports were uncertain. Besides,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4530","context":"according to newspapers at Aden, the Arabs were said to have fought"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4531","context":"with the English; therein there seemed to be offered an opportunity"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4532","context":"near at hand to damage the enemy. I therefore sailed with the _Choising_"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4533","context":"in the direction of Aden. Lieutenant Cordts of the _Choising_ had"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4534","context":"heard that the Arabian railway already went almost to Hodeida,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4535","context":"near the Perin Strait. The ship's surgeon there, Docounlang, found"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4536","context":"confirmation of this in Meyer's Traveling Handbook. This railway"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4537","context":"could not have been taken over by the Englishmen, who always dreamt"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4538","context":"of it. By doing this they would have further and completely wrought"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4539","context":"up the Mohammedans by making more difficult the journey to Mecca."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4540","context":"Best of all, we thought, 'We'll simply step into the express train"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4541","context":"and whizz nicely away to the North Sea.' Certainly there would be"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4542","context":"safe journeying homeward through Arabia. To be sure, we had maps"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4543","context":"of the Red Sea; but it was the shortest way to the foe whether in"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4553","context":"the distance by night, three thousand meters, I began to think"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4554","context":"that must be something else. At dawn I made out two masts and four"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4639","context":"sailed at a considerable distance apart, so that we would not both"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4640","context":"be captured if an English gunboat caught us. Therefore, we always"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4641","context":"had to sail in coastal water. That is full of coral reefs, however.\""}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4643","context":"Captain Mücke had charge of the first sambuk. Everything went well"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4644","context":"for three days. On the third day the order was given for the sambuks"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4645","context":"to keep near together because the pilot of the first one was sailing"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4646","context":"less skillfully than the other. Suddenly, in the twilight the men"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4647","context":"in the second sambuk felt a shock, then another, and a third. The"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4648","context":"water poured into it rapidly. It had run upon the reef of a small"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4649","context":"island, where the smaller sambuk had been able to pass on account"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4650","context":"of its lighter draft. Soon the stranded boat began to list over,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4651","context":"and the twenty-eight men aboard had to sit on the gunwale."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4653","context":"\"We could scarcely move,\" narrated Lieutenant Gerdts, who commanded"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4654","context":"the stranded boat. \"The other boat was nowhere in sight. Now it"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4655","context":"grew dark. At this stage I began to build a raft of spars and old"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4656","context":"pieces of wood that might keep us afloat. But soon the first boat"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4657","context":"came into sight again. The commander turned about and sent over"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4658","context":"his little canoe; in this and in our own canoe, in which two men"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4659","context":"could sit at each trip, we first transferred the sick. Now the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4660","context":"Arabs began to help us. But just then the tropical helmet of our"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4661","context":"doctor suddenly appeared above the water in which he was standing"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4662","context":"up to his ears. Thereupon the Arabs withdrew: We were Christians,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4663","context":"and they did not know that we were friends. Now the other sambuk"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4664","context":"was so near that we could have swum to it in half an hour, but"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4665","context":"the seas were too high. At each trip a good swimmer trailed along,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4666","context":"hanging to the painter of the canoe. When it became altogether"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4667","context":"dark we could not see the boat any more, for over there they were"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4668","context":"prevented by the wind from keeping any light burning. My men asked:"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4669","context":"'In what direction shall we swim?' I answered: 'Swim in the direction"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4670","context":"of this or that star; that must be about the direction of the boat.'"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4671","context":"Finally a torch flared up over there--one of the torches that was"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4672","context":"still left from the _Emden_. But we had suffered considerably through"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4673","context":"submersion. One sailor cried out: 'Oh, psha! It's all up with us"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4674","context":"now, that's a searchlight.' About ten o'clock we were all safe"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4675","context":"aboard, but one of our typhus patients wore himself out completely"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4676","context":"by exertion and died a week later. On the next morning we went over"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4677","context":"again to the wreck in order to seek the weapons that had fallen"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4678","context":"into the water. You see, the Arabs dive so well; they fetched up"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4679","context":"a considerable lot--both machine guns, all but ten of the rifles,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4680","context":"though these were, to be sure, all full of water. Later they frequently"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4681","context":"failed to go off when they were used in firing."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4683","context":"\"Now we numbered, together with the Arabs, seventy men on the little"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4684","context":"boat. Then we anchored before Konfida and met Sami Bey. He had"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4685","context":"shown himself useful, even before, in the service of the Turkish"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4686","context":"Government, and had done good service as a guide in the last months"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4687","context":"of the adventure. He procured for us a larger boat of fifty-four tons."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4688","context":"We sailed from the 20th of March, 1915, to the 24th, unmolested to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4689","context":"Lith. There Sami Bey announced that three English ships were cruising"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4690","context":"about in order to intercept us. I therefore advised traveling a bit"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4691","context":"overland. I disliked leaving the sea a second time, but it had to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4694","context":"Captain Mücke explained that Lith is nothing but desert, and therefore"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4695","context":"it was very difficult to get up a caravan at once. They marched away"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4696","context":"on March 28, 1915, with only a vague suspicion that the English"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4697","context":"might have agents here also. They could travel only at night, and"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4698","context":"when they slept or camped around a spring, there was only a tent for"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4699","context":"the sick men. Two days' march from Jeddah, the Turkish Government"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4700","context":"having received word about the crew, sent sixteen good camels."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4702","context":"\"Suddenly, on the night of April 1, 1915, things became uneasy,\""}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4703","context":"said Captain Mücke. \"I was riding at the head of the column. All"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4704","context":"our shooting implements were cleared for action, because there was"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4705","context":"danger of an attack from Bedouins, whom the English had bribed."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4706","context":"When it began to grow a bit light I thought: 'We're through for"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4707","context":"to-day'; for we were tired--had been riding eighteen hours. Suddenly"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4708","context":"I saw a line flash up before me, and shots whizzed over our heads."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4709","context":"Down from the camels! We formed a fighting line. You know how quickly"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4710","context":"it becomes daylight there. The whole space around the desert hillock"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4711","context":"was occupied. Now we had to take up our guns. We rushed at the enemy."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4712","context":"They fled, but returned again, this time from all sides. Several of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4713","context":"the gendarmes that had been given to us as an escort were wounded;"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4714","context":"the machine-gun operator fell, killed by a shot through the heart;"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4715","context":"another was wounded. Lieutenant Schmidt was mortally wounded. He"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4716","context":"received a bullet in the chest and another in the abdomen."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4718","context":"\"Suddenly, they waved white cloths. The sheik, to whom a part of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4719","context":"our camels belonged, went over to them to negotiate, then Sami"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4720","context":"Bey and his wife. In the interim we quickly built a sort of wagon"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4721","context":"barricade, a circular camp of camel saddles, of rice and coffee"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4722","context":"sacks, all of which we filled with sand. We had no shovels, and had"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4723","context":"to dig with our bayonets, plates, and hands. The whole barricade"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4724","context":"had a diameter of fifty meters. Behind it were dug trenches, which"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4725","context":"we deepened even during the skirmish. The camels inside had to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4726","context":"lie down, and thus served very well as cover for the rear of the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4727","context":"trenches. Then an inner wall was constructed, behind which we carried"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4728","context":"the sick men. In the very center we buried two jars of water, to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4729","context":"guard us against thirst. In addition we had ten petroleum cans full"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4730","context":"of water; all told, a supply for four days. Late in the evening"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4731","context":"Sami's wife came back from the futile negotiations, alone. She had"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4732","context":"unveiled for the first and only time on this day of the skirmish,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4733","context":"had distributed cartridges and had acted faultlessly."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4735","context":"\"Soon we were able to ascertain the number of the enemy. There"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4736","context":"were about 300 men; we numbered fifty, with twenty-nine machine"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4737","context":"guns. In the night Lieutenant Schmidt died. We had to dig his grave"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4738","context":"with our hands and with our bayonets, and to eliminate every trace"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4739","context":"above it, in order to protect the body. Rademacher had been buried"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4740","context":"immediately after the skirmish with all honors."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4742","context":"\"The wounded had a hard time of it. We had lost our medicine chest"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4743","context":"in the wreck; we had only little packages of bandages for skirmishes;"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4744","context":"but no probing instrument, no scissors, were at hand. On the next day"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4745","context":"our men came up with thick tongues, feverish, and crying: 'Water,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4746","context":"water!' But each one received only a little cupful three times"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4747","context":"each day. If our water supply became exhausted we would have to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4748","context":"sally forth from our camp and fight our way through. At night we"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4749","context":"always dragged out the dead camels that had served as cover and"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4750","context":"had been shot."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4752","context":"\"This continued about three days. On the third day there were new"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4753","context":"negotiations. Now the Bedouins demanded arms no longer, but only"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4754","context":"money. This time the negotiations took place across the camp wall."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4755","context":"When I declined the Bedouin said, 'Lots of fight.' I said, 'Please"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4756","context":"go to it.'"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4758","context":"\"We had only a little ammunition left, and very little water. Now"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4759","context":"it really looked as if we would soon be dispatched. The mood of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4760","context":"the men was pretty dismal. Suddenly, at about ten o'clock in the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4761","context":"morning, there bobbed up in the north two riders on camels, waving"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4762","context":"white cloths. Soon afterward there appeared, coming from the same"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4763","context":"direction, far back, a long row of camel troops, about a hundred;"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4764","context":"they drew rapidly nearer, rode singing toward us, in a picturesque"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4765","context":"train. They were the messengers and the troops of the Emir of Mecca."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4767","context":"\"Sami Bey's wife, it developed, had in the course of the first"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4768","context":"negotiations, dispatched an Arab boy to Jeddah. From that place"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4769","context":"the governor had telegraphed to the emir. The latter at once sent"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4770","context":"camel troops with his two sons and his personal surgeon; the elder,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4771","context":"Abdullah, conducted the negotiations, and the surgeon acted as"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4772","context":"interpreter in French. Now things proceeded in one-two-three order,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4773","context":"and the whole Bedouin band speedily disappeared. From what I learned"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4774","context":"later I know definitely that they had been corrupted with bribes by"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4775","context":"the English. They knew when and where we would pass, and they had"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4776","context":"made all preparations. Now our first act was a rush for water; then"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4777","context":"we cleared up our camp, but had to harness our camels ourselves, for"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4778","context":"the camel drivers had fled at the very beginning of the skirmish."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4780","context":"\"Then, under the safe protection of Turkish troops, we got to Jeddah."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4781","context":"There the authorities and the populace received us very well. From"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4782","context":"there we proceeded in nineteen days by sail boat to Elwesh, and"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4783","context":"under abundant guard with the Suleiman Pasha, in a five-day caravan"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4784","context":"journeyed to El Ula.\""}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4786","context":"\"Have I received the Iron Cross?\" was the first question Captain"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4787","context":"Mücke asked when he got to that place, and old newspapers which"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4788","context":"he found there told him that he had. A few days later the party"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4798","context":"The first year of the war came to an end in August, 1915, with"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4799","context":"the naval situation much the same as it stood at the end of the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4800","context":"first six months. The navy of practically every belligerent was"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4801","context":"intact; the Allies enjoyed the freedom of the seas, but the fact"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4802","context":"that a German fleet lay intact in the North Sea, and an Austrian"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4803","context":"fleet lay intact in the Adriatic Sea, indicated only the naval"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4804","context":"supremacy of the Allies, but not that they had won decisive naval"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4805","context":"victories."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4807","context":"As there had been no victory there had been no defeat, yet there"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4808","context":"had been losses to all concerned. The mine and the submarine had"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4809","context":"changed somewhat the methods of naval warfare--the enemies \"nibbled\""}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4810","context":"at their opponents' fleets. Battleships were lost, though the first"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4811","context":"year of the Great War had seen no pitched battle between ships of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4812","context":"that class."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4814","context":"During the second six months of the war England lost the five old"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4815","context":"battleships _Irresistible, Ocean, Goliath, Triumph_, and _Majestic_;"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4816","context":"the destroyers _Recruit_ and _Maori_; and the submarine _E-15_ and"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4817","context":"another unidentified; and the auxiliary cruisers _Clan McNaughton,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4818","context":"Bayano_, and _Princess Irene_. Her ally France had lost, during the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4819","context":"same period, the old battleship _Bouvet_, the cruiser _Leon Gambetta_,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4820","context":"the destroyer _Dague_, and the submarines _Joule, Mariotte_, and"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4821","context":"one unidentified."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4823","context":"The losses on the other side were confined to the German navy,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4824","context":"with the exception of the Turkish cruiser _Medjidieh_. Germany lost"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4825","context":"the battleship _Pommern_; the cruisers _Dresden_ and _Königsberg_;"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4826","context":"the submarines _U-12, U-29, U-8_, one of the type of the _U-2_,"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4830","context":"_G-196_, the mine layer _Albatross_, and the auxiliary cruise _Meteor_."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4832","context":"In retaliation for having her flag swept from the seas, Germany's"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4833","context":"submarines, during the second six months of the war, had sunk a"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4834","context":"total of 153 merchant ships, including those belonging to neutral"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4835","context":"countries as well as to her enemies. The total tonnage of these"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4836","context":"was about 500,000 tons; 1,643 persons died in going down with these"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4839","context":"Not of the least importance were the precedents that were established,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4840","context":"or attempted to be established, by Germany in conducting naval"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4841","context":"warfare with her submarine craft. In a note delivered to the United"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4842","context":"States Government, the German Government declared that British"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4843","context":"merchant vessels were not only armed and instructed to resist or"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4844","context":"even attack submarines, but often disguised as to nationality."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4845","context":"Under such circumstances it was assumed to be impossible for a"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4846","context":"submarine commander to conform to the established custom of visit"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4847","context":"and search. Accordingly, vessels of neutral nations were urgently"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4848","context":"warned not to enter the submarine war zone. The war zone which she"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4849","context":"proclaimed about Great Britain had no precedent in history, and"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4850","context":"it immediately brought to her door a number of controversies with"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4851","context":"neutrals, particularly the United States. The sinking of liners"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4852","context":"carrying passengers claiming citizenship in neutral countries was"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4853","context":"another precedent, which had the same effect with regard to diplomatic"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4854","context":"exchanges."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4856","context":"Predictions that had been made long before the war came were found"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4857","context":"to be worthless; there were those who had predicted that Germany"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4858","context":"in the event of war with England would give immediate battle with"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4859","context":"her largest ships; but twelve months went by without an actual"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4860","context":"battle between superdreadnoughts. \"Der Tag\" had not come. There"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4861","context":"were those who had predicted that the British navy would force"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4862","context":"the German ships out of their protected harbors. \"We shall dig"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4868","context":"Certain lessons had been taught naval authorities of all nations"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4869","context":"through the actual use of the modern battleship in war. The first"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4870","context":"year showed that the largest ships must have very high speed and"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4871","context":"long gun range. To some extent the fact that the fighting ships of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4872","context":"nearly all of the belligerent countries were thus equipped changed"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4873","context":"battle tactics."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4875","context":"When the allied fleets had started their bombardment of the Turkish"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4876","context":"forts at the Dardanelles they were breaking certain well-defined"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4877","context":"rules which had been axiomatic with naval authorities. The greatest"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4878","context":"of modern battleships were designed to fight with craft of their"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4879","context":"like, but not to take issue with land fortifications. For weeks,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4880","context":"while the fleets succeeded in silencing for a time some of the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4881","context":"Turkish forts, it was thought that this rule no longer held good."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4882","context":"But when, after March 19, 1915, the fleets ceased attempting to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4883","context":"take the passage without military cooperation, the worth of the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4884","context":"rule was reestablished. The ease with which the bombarding ships"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4885","context":"were made victims of hostile submarines was greatly instrumental"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4886","context":"in making the rule again an axiom."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4888","context":"The naval supremacy of the allied powers brought them certain"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4889","context":"advantages--advantages which they had without winning a decisive"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4891","context":"and were troubled, in consequence, by shortage in food for their"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4892","context":"civilian populations to a greater or lesser degree. This was perhaps"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4893","context":"a negative benefit derived by the Allies from their naval supremacy;"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4894","context":"the affirmative benefit was that their own communications with"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4924","context":"naval warfare had opened. In all previous wars, and in the earlier"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4925","context":"months of the Great War, submarines were employed as auxiliaries"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4926","context":"to the larger naval units. The Germans were the first to use them"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4927","context":"as separate units. The idea of sending a fleet of submarines out on"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4928","context":"to the high seas was a new one, and had been impossible in the last"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4937","context":"preceding the war, had spent the same amounts of money on this"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4938","context":"sort of craft--about $18,000,000--but while the Germans had later"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4939","context":"given as much attention to them as to any other sort of naval craft,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4940","context":"the British authorities did not figure on employing the submarine"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4941","context":"as a separate offensive tactical unit being sufficiently equipped"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4942","context":"in large ships carrying large guns. And being weaker in capital"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4943","context":"ships Germany was compelled to rely upon underwater warfare in"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4944","context":"her campaign of attrition. Not only were the naval authorities"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4945","context":"of the rest of the world uninformed about the improvements that"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4946","context":"German submarines carried, but they were fooled even as to the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4947","context":"actual number which Germany had built."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4949","context":"The most modern of the German submarines at the time had a length"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4950","context":"of 213 feet and a beam of twenty feet, these dimensions giving"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4951","context":"them sufficient deck space to mount thereon two rapid-fire guns,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4952","context":"one of 3.5 inches and another of 1.4 inches. Their displacement was"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4953","context":"900 tons, and they could make a speed of 18 knots when traveling"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4954","context":"\"light\" (above water), and 12 knots when traveling submerged. These"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4955","context":"speeds made it possible for them to overtake all but the fastest"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4956","context":"merchantmen, though not fast enough to run away from destroyers,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4957","context":"gunboats, and fast cruisers. Their range of operation was 2,000"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4958","context":"miles, and in the early months of 1915, it was possible for Germany"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4959","context":"to send two or three of them from their base in the North Sea to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4960","context":"the Mediterranean. Germany was at the same time experimenting with"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4961","context":"a larger type, with a displacement of 1,200 tons and an operating"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4962","context":"distance of 5,000 miles."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4964","context":"The ordinary submarine in service at the beginning of the war could"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4966","context":"amounts of air for breathing were carried in tanks under pressure,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4967","context":"and in the German type there were also chemical improvements for"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4968","context":"regenerating air. Contrary to the opinion of laymen, submerging"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4969","context":"was accomplished both by letting water into ballast tanks, and"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4970","context":"also by properly deflecting a set of rudders; every submarine had"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4971","context":"two sets of rudders, one of which worked in vertical planes and"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4972","context":"pointed the prow of the ship either to the left or the right; the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4973","context":"other pair worked in horizontal planes and turned the prow either"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4974","context":"upward or downward. A pair of fins on the sides of the hull assisted"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4975","context":"action in both rising and diving. The action of water against the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4976","context":"fins and rudders when the ship was in motion was exactly the same"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4977","context":"as that of the air against the planes of a kite; to submerge one"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4978","context":"of the craft it was necessary to have it in motion and to have"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4979","context":"its horizontal rudders so placed that the resistance of the water"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4980","context":"would drive the ship downward; the reverse operation drove it upward."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4981","context":"And here lay a danger, for if the engines of a diving submarine"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4982","context":"stopped she was bound to come to the surface. Her presence, while"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4983","context":"moving entirely submerged could be detected by a peculiar swell"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4985","context":"to leave the tip of her periscope still showing, the latter left"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4986","context":"an easily discernible wake."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4988","context":"The periscope was merely a tube in which there were arranged mirrors"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4989","context":"so that anything reflected in the first mirror, the one above the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4990","context":"surface of the water, was again reflected till it showed in a mirror"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4991","context":"at the bottom of the tube, within the hull of the vessel, where"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4992","context":"its commander could observe it safely. A crew of about twenty-five"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4993","context":"men was necessary to operate one of these crafts, and theirs was"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4994","context":"an unpleasant duty, first because of the danger that accompanied"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4995","context":"each submergence of their vessel; second because of the discomforts"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4996","context":"abroad. The explosive engines which drove the craft, whether burning"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4997","context":"oil or the lighter refinements such as gasoline, gave off gases"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4998","context":"that caused headaches and throbbing across the forehead; and it"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_4999","context":"was almost impossible to heat the interior of the craft."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5001","context":"Though merchantmen had gone to the bottom as victims of German"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5002","context":"submarines before, the proclamation of a \"war zone\" was issued"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5003","context":"they were individual cases; the first instance of a merchant ship"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5004","context":"being sunk as a result of the new policy of the German admiralty"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5005","context":"was the sinking of the British steamer _Cambark_ on the 20th of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5006","context":"February, 1915. This ship was bound for Liverpool, from Huelva,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5007","context":"Spain. While off the north coast of Wales, on the morning of the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5008","context":"20th, the periscope of a hostile submarine was sighted only 200"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5009","context":"yards ahead. The engines of the steamship were immediately reversed,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5010","context":"but she had no time to make off, for a torpedo caught her amidships"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5011","context":"and she started to sink immediately. Her crew managed to get off"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5012","context":"in small boats, but all of their personal belongings were lost."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5014","context":"The small Irish coasting steamer _Downshire_ was made a victim"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5015","context":"on the 21st of February, 1915, but instead of sending a torpedo"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5016","context":"into her hull, the commander of the _U-12_, the submarine which"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5017","context":"overhauled her, resorted to boarding. After trying to elude the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5018","context":"submarine by steering a zigzag course, the _Downshire_ was finally"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5019","context":"overtaken. The crew was ordered to take to the small boats, while"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5020","context":"nineteen men of the submarine, which had come above water, watched"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5021","context":"the operations from the deck. A crew from the submarine took one of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5022","context":"the small boats of the steamship and rowed toward her. They placed"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5023","context":"a bomb in a vital spot and set it off, sinking the merchantman."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5024","context":"In this way the submarine's commander had saved a torpedo. A"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5025","context":"conversation which took place between the captains of the two craft"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5026","context":"revealed the methods by which the submarine commanders were able,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5027","context":"not only to steal up on their intended victims, but to elude being"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5028","context":"sighted by the patrolling British warships. Some fishing smacks"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5029","context":"had been in the vicinity while the _Downshire_ was sunk, and the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5030","context":"British captain asked the German captain why they had not been"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5031","context":"attacked. The latter hinted that his plans worked best if the fishing"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5032","context":"boats were unmolested. When asked whether he had hidden behind"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5033","context":"one these little boats he changed the subject, but it was learned"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5034","context":"later that the commanders of the submarines made a practice of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5035","context":"coming to the surface right near fishing boats and bade them act"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5036","context":"as screens while they lay in wait for victims. By keeping the small"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5037","context":"boats covered with a deck gun or by putting a boarding crew aboard,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5038","context":"it was possible for the commanders of the submarines to keep their"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5039","context":"periscopes or the hulls of their vessels behind the sails of the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5040","context":"fishing boats, unobservable to lookouts on larger ships."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5042","context":"By the 23d of February, 1915, the success of German submarines"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5043","context":"had been so marked that the insurance rates on merchantmen went"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5044","context":"up. Lloyd's underwriters announced that the rate on transatlantic"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5045","context":"passage had gone up nearly one per cent. And on the same day it"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5046","context":"was announced that the British Government would thereafter regulate"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5047","context":"steamship traffic in the Irish Sea. Certain areas of the Irish"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5048","context":"Sea were closed to all kinds of traffic; lines of passage were"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5049","context":"defined and had to be followed by all merchantmen, and vessels"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5050","context":"of all descriptions were ordered to keep away from certain parts"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5051","context":"of the coast from sunset to sunrise."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5053","context":"The comparatively small size of the submarines made it possible"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5054","context":"for the German admiralty to load them on to trains in sections"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5055","context":"and transport them where needed, and in this manner some were sent"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5056","context":"from the German ports on the North Sea to Zeebrugge, there assembled"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5057","context":"and launched. Others were sent to the Adriatic, arriving at Pola"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5058","context":"on the 25th of February, 1915. These were intended for use in the"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5061","context":"Neutral ships, in order to escape attack by German submarines had"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5062","context":"to resort to unusual methods of self-identification. The use of flags"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5063","context":"belonging to neutral countries by the merchantmen of belligerent"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5064","context":"powers made the usual identification by colors almost impossible,"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5066","context":"unable to wait long enough, after stopping a vessel, to ascertain"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5067","context":"whether she had a right to fly one flag or another. Consequently"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5068","context":"the ships belonging to Dutch and American lines had their names"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5069","context":"painted with large lettering along their sides. At night, streamers"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5070","context":"of electric lights were hung over the sides to illuminate these"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5071","context":"letterings; and on the decks of many of the neutral ships their"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5072","context":"names and nationalities were painted in large letters so that they"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5073","context":"might be identified by aircraft. Owing to such precautions the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5074","context":"Dutch steamship _Prinzes Juliana_ escaped being sunk by a torpedo"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5075","context":"on the 3d of March, 1915. A submarine ran a parallel course to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5076","context":"that followed by the Dutch ship, but after examining the lettering"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5077","context":"on her sides the commander of the German craft saw that she was"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5080","context":"Not always did the German submarines themselves succeed in escaping"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5081","context":"unharmed in their raiding of allied merchantmen. Rewards were offered"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5082","context":"in Great Britain for the sinking of German submersibles by the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5083","context":"commanders of British merchantmen. Instructions were issued in"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5084","context":"the British shipping periodicals, showing how a submarine might"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5085","context":"be sunk by being rammed. It was officially announced on the 5th"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5087","context":"rammed and sunk by a British warship. The crew of twenty-nine was"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5088","context":"rescued and brought to Dover. For the British this was a stroke"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5089","context":"of good fortune, for while the _U-8_ was of an earlier type it"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5090","context":"was a dangerous craft, having a total displacement of 300 tons,"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5092","context":"traveling \"light\" and a speed of 8 knots when submerged. On the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5093","context":"same day the French minister of marine announced that a French"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5261","context":"Her chance for launching a torpedo was gone, but she brought her deck"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5540","context":"minutes she was filled level full. Then a keg floated up, and I"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5541","context":"pitched it about ten feet away and followed it. After reaching"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5542","context":"the keg I turned to see what had been the fate of our boat. She"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5543","context":"had capsized. Now a young steward, Freeman, approached me, clinging"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5544","context":"to a deck chair. I urged him to grab the other side of the keg"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5545","context":"several times. He grew faint, but harsh speaking roused him. Once"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5546","context":"he said: 'I am going to go.' But I ridiculed this, and it gave"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5782","context":"right over the _U-51_ while she was submerged. Captain Hersing"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5787","context":"as the target for a torpedo and she went down. Again submerging his"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_5812","context":"the British admiralty commissioned ten such craft during the week"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6236","context":"these debouchments with a firm grip, and the pass was consequently"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6237","context":"of no use to the Austrians. About February 7, 1915, the Russians"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6238","context":"attempted to outflank the Austrian position in the Lupkow Pass"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6239","context":"from the eastern branch of the Dukla by pushing forward in the"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6241","context":"succeeded; they took over 10,000 prisoners, but failed to dislodge"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6242","context":"the Austrians from the heights east of the pass. Severe fighting"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6243","context":"raged round this district for over a month, the Russians finally"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6253","context":"forward in the direction of Stryj and Lemberg, but never reached"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6281","context":"the other, they had to be taken back over the range into Hungary"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6282","context":"to the junction where the roads diverged. It was sound strategy"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6283","context":"on the Russian side to select Koziowa as the point from which to"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6300","context":"C--the third column? His path lay through Jablonitza, Kirlibaba,"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6302","context":"Bukowina, and either to force them back across their own frontiers,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6303","context":"or to turn the extreme end of their left flank. We have seen that"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6304","context":"the Russian occupation of the Bukowina was more in the nature of"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6320","context":"Russian reenforcements were thrown into the town, and the struggle"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6324","context":"the railways which supplied those Russian armies which were barring"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6325","context":"the advance through the central passes. The Russians were forced to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6326","context":"withdraw from Stanislawow, and their opponents now held possession"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6327","context":"of the line running to Stryj and Przemysl--a serious menace to the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6328","context":"Russian main communications. This meant that Von Pflanzer-Baltin"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6329","context":"had succeeded in getting to the rear of the Russians. But assistance"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6330","context":"came unexpectedly from the center, whence Ivanoff was able to send"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6331","context":"reenforcements to his colleague, General Alexeieff, who was continually"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6332","context":"falling back before the Austrians. Furious counterattacks were"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6333","context":"delivered by the Russians at Halicz and Jezupol, the bridgeheads"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6334","context":"of the southern bank of the Dniester. If the Austrians could not"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6335","context":"force a victory at these points, their position in Stanislawow"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6336","context":"would be untenable, since the Russians still had a clear road to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6337","context":"pour reenforcements into the fighting area between the Dniester and"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6338","context":"the Carpathians. On March 1, 1915, the Austrians were defeated at"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6339","context":"Halicz in a pitched battle, and on the 4th the Russians reentered"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6340","context":"Stanislawow. According to their official communiqué the Russians"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6341","context":"captured nearly 19,000 prisoners, 5 guns, 62 machine guns, and"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6342","context":"a quantity of stores and munitions. About March 16 the opposing"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6372","context":"up from east, north, and west, and within a few days the Austrians"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6373","context":"were sent back along the whole front. From the region of Przemysl"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6374","context":"three railroads cross the Carpathians to Budapest, along all of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6375","context":"which the Russians had pushed vigorously, besides advancing on the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6376","context":"west. As regarded railroad communications, the fate of Przemysl"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6377","context":"was sealed by the capture of Chyrow, an important junction about"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6378","context":"twenty miles south of the fortress. Przemysl itself was important"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6379","context":"as a road junction and as a connecting link with the Uzsok and"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6380","context":"Lupkow passes. The garrison prepared to make a stubborn resistance"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6381","context":"with the object of checking the Russian pursuit. A week later the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6382","context":"Russians had broken up their heavy artillery and had begun a steady"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6383","context":"bombardment. By November 12, 1914, Przemysl was once more completely"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6384","context":"besieged by General Selivanoff with not more than 100,000 troops."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6386","context":"Przemysl is one of the oldest towns of Galicia, said to have been"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6387","context":"founded in the eighth century. It was once the capital of a large"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6388","context":"independent principality. In the fourteenth century Casimir the Great"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6389","context":"and other Polish princes endowed it with special civic privileges,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6390","context":"and the town attained a high degree of commercial prosperity. In"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6391","context":"the seventeenth century its importance was destroyed by inroads"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6392","context":"of Tatars, Cossacks, and Swedes. Przemysl is situated on the River"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6393","context":"San, and was considered one of the strongest fortresses of Europe."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6395","context":"The original strategic idea embodied in the purpose of the fortress"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6396","context":"was purely defensive; in the event of war with Russia only the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6397","context":"line of the San and Dniester was intended to be held at all costs,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6398","context":"while the whole northeastern portion of Galicia was to be abandoned."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6399","context":"With the fortress of Cracow guarding the west, Przemysl was meant"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6400","context":"to be the first defense between the two rivers and to hold the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6401","context":"easiest roads to Hungary through the Dukla, Lupkow, and Uzsok passes."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6402","context":"Within the last ten years, however, the Austrian War Staff altered"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6403","context":"its plans and decided upon a vigorous offensive against Russia"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6404","context":"should occasion offer, and that Eastern Galicia was not to be"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6405","context":"sacrificed. Hence a network of strategic railways was constructed"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6406","context":"with a view to attacking the prospective enemy on a wide front"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6407","context":"extending from the Vistula near Cracow on the west to the Bug on"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6408","context":"the east, where the latter flows into Austrian territory and cuts"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6409","context":"off a corner of eastern Galicia. The plan does not appear to have"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6410","context":"worked successfully, for, before the war was many days old, the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6411","context":"Russians had taken Lemberg, swept across the Dniester at Halicz,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6412","context":"across the San at Jaroslav, just north of Przemysl, and had already"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6413","context":"besieged the fortress, which at no time imposed any serious obstacle"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6414","context":"in the path of their progress. Perhaps the only useful purpose that"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6415","context":"Przemysl served was that it restrained the Russians from attempting"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6416","context":"an invasion of Hungary on a big scale, by holding out for nearly seven"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6417","context":"months. Not having sufficient siege artillery at their disposal,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6418","context":"the Russians made no attempt to storm the place. General Selivanoff"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6419","context":"surrounded the forts with a wide circle of counterdefenses, which"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6420","context":"were so strongly fortified that the garrison would have found it an"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6421","context":"almost hopeless task to attempt a rush through the enemy's lines."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6422","context":"The Austrian artillery was naturally well acquainted with the range"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6423","context":"of every point and position that lay within reach of their guns;"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6424","context":"and Selivanoff wisely offered them little opportunity for effective"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6425","context":"practice. Considering it too expensive to attack by the overland"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6426","context":"route, he worked his way gradually toward the forts by means of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6427","context":"underground operations. To sap a position is slow work, but much"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6428","context":"more economical in the expenditure of lives and munitions. The"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6429","context":"weakness of Przemysl lay in the fact that its garrison was far"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6430","context":"too large for its needs, and that provisions were running short."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6431","context":"In the early part of the campaign the Germanic armies operating"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6432","context":"in the San region had drawn freely on Przemysl for supplies, and"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6433","context":"before these could be adequately replaced the Russians had again"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6434","context":"forged an iron ring around the place. The Russian commander, moreover,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6435","context":"was aware that a coming scarcity threatened the town, and that he"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6436","context":"had only to bide his time to starve it into submission. Whilst he"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6437","context":"was simply waiting and ever strengthening his lines, the Austrians"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6438","context":"found it incumbent on them to assume the offensive. Several desperate"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6439","context":"sorties were made by the garrison to break through the wall, only to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6440","context":"end in complete disaster. General Herman von Kusmanek, the commander"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6441","context":"in chief of the fortress, organized a special force, composed largely"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6442","context":"of Hungarians, for \"sortie duty,\" under the command of a Hungarian,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6443","context":"General von Tamassy. These sorties had been carried out during"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6444","context":"November and December, 1914, especially during the latter month,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6445","context":"when the Austro-German armies were pouring across the mountains."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6446","context":"So critical was the Russian position at the time that the relief"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6447","context":"of Przemysl was hourly expected. According to an officer of General"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6448","context":"Selivanoff's staff, \"The Austrians in the fortress were already"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6449","context":"conversing with the Austrians on the Carpathians by means of their"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6452","context":"took prompt measures. He brought up fresh troops to the point of"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6455","context":"had succeeded in breaking through the Russian lines and marching"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6456","context":"to a point fifteen miles beyond the outer lines of the forts. A"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6457","context":"Russian official announcement states that during two months of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6458","context":"the siege the Austrian captures amounted only to 4 machine guns"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6459","context":"and about 60 prisoners, which occurred in an engagement where two"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6460","context":"Honved regiments fell on a Russian company which had advanced too"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6461","context":"far to be reenforced in time. On their part in repulsing sorties by"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6462","context":"the garrison, frequently made by considerable forces, the Russians"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6463","context":"made prisoners 27 officers and 1,906 soldiers, and captured 7 machine"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6464","context":"guns, 1,500,000 cartridges, and a large quantity of arms. In two"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6465","context":"sorties the garrison in the region of Bircza had more than 2,000"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6466","context":"killed and wounded, among them being many officers. No further"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6468","context":"and February, 1915, very little fighting took place around Przemysl;"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_6469","context":"sorties were useless as there was no Austro-German force anywhere"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7008","context":"flows from the Polish frontier down to the Tarnow Pass, that the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7009","context":"mighty thunderbolt had been forged. Thousands of heavy guns were"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7010","context":"here planted in position, and millions of shells conveyed thither"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7011","context":"under cover of night. Countless trains carried war materials, tents,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7012","context":"pontoons, cattle, provisions, etc. Finally the troops arrived--from"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7013","context":"the different fronts where they could be spared, and new levies"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7014","context":"from Germany and Austria-Hungary. Smoothly and silently men and"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7015","context":"machines dropped into their respective places: All was ready; not"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7016","context":"a detail had been overlooked; German organization had done its"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7035","context":"and Lechitsky in the Bukowina in the place of Alexeieff, who had"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7036","context":"succeeded General Russky in the northern group. The whole southern"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7037","context":"group, from the Nida to the Sereth inclusive, was under the supreme"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7038","context":"command of General Ivanoff. Facing Dmitrieff on the Dunajec front"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7039","context":"stood now the Fourth Austro-Hungarian Army under the Archduke Joseph"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7040","context":"Ferdinand, about five army corps, including a German cavalry division"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7041","context":"under General von Besser; then the Ninth and Fourteenth Austrian"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7047","context":"Tenth Army Corps under General Martiny. This formidable combination"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7048","context":"now confronted the Dunajec-Biala positions, which Dmitrieff had"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7049","context":"held without exertion for four months. Only a mile or two away he"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7050","context":"still inspected his trenches and conducted his minor operations,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7051","context":"totally unconscious of the brewing storm specially directed against"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7052","context":"him. The Laborza district was held by the Archduke Joseph with the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7053","context":"Seventh Army Corps; on his left stood a German corps under Von"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7054","context":"Marwitz, and on his right the Tenth Army Corps, north of Bartfeld,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7055","context":"with some additional forces in between. Around the Lupkow and Uzsok"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7056","context":"passes the Second Austro-Hungarian Army under Boehm-Ermolli was"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7057","context":"stationed where it had been since February, 1915. Next, on the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7058","context":"right, the Austro-Hungarian army corps under Von Goglia; in the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7059","context":"Uzsok lay an army under Von Szurmay, nearly all Magyars, of whom"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7060","context":"the chief commander was Von Linsingen. Farther eastward stood a"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7061","context":"Prussian corps, embodying a division of Prussian Guards and other"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7062","context":"regiments commanded by General Bothmer, a Bavarian, who had been"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7064","context":"the corps of Generals Hofmann and Fleischman, composed of all Austrian"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7065","context":"nationalities, intrenched in the mountain valleys. More German troops"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7066","context":"held the next sector, and, finally, came Von Pflanzer-Baltin's"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7067","context":"army groups in the Bukowina and Eastern Galicia. Against this huge"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7068","context":"iron ring of at least twenty-four Germanic corps (about 2,000,000"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7069","context":"men) and a great store of reserves, the Russians could not muster"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7070","context":"more than about fourteen of their own corps. As has already been"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7071","context":"pointed out, the greatest disparity of strength existed on the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7072","context":"Dunajec line, where Dmitrieff stood opposed to about half of the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7073","context":"enemy's entire force with only five corps of Russian troops. The"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7074","context":"Austro-German forces, moreover, were infinitely better equipped with"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7075","context":"munitions and heavy artillery. The lack of big guns was undoubtedly"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7076","context":"the reason why the Russians had not attempted an invasion of Hungary."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7077","context":"Hence they stuck to the mountain passes where their opponents were"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7078","context":"unable to carry their artillery, although they were amply supplied"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7079","context":"with the same. It is true that the Russians could have produced"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7080","context":"an equal--or even greater--number of men, but they had not the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7081","context":"arms and accouterments."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7083","context":"Speaking from safe knowledge after the event, it is possible to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7084","context":"indicate with moderate accuracy at least one of the ingenious stratagems"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7085","context":"adopted by the Germans to disguise their tremendous preparations"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7086","context":"against the Dunajec line. For months the fighting in this region had"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7087","context":"never been severe. When, therefore, local attacks and counterattacks"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7088","context":"on a small scale started on the Biala, as far back as April 4, 1915,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7089","context":"Dmitrieff and his staff regarded this activity on the Austrians"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7090","context":"part as merely a continuation of the sporadic assaults they had"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7091","context":"grown accustomed to. Besides holding his own, Dmitrieff had on"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7092","context":"several occasions been able to assist Brussilov on his left. Until"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7093","context":"the big German drive commenced they had only been opposed to three"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7094","context":"Austro-German army corps and a Prussian division; now there were"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7095","context":"twelve corps on their front, supplied with enormous resources of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7096","context":"artillery, shells, and cavalry. Most serious of all, Dmitrieff had"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7097","context":"neglected to construct second and third lines to which he could"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7098","context":"retire in an emergency. Of the rivers that lay behind him--the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7099","context":"Wisloka, the Wistok, and the San--the first would be useful to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7100","context":"cover Brussilov's position at the western passes, but beyond that"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7101","context":"he could not retreat without imperiling the whole Carpathian right"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7102","context":"flank. It was on this very calculation that the German plan--simple"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7103","context":"but effective--was based. The Russian grip on the Carpathians could"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7104","context":"only be released either by forcing a clear road through any pass"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7105","context":"into Galicia, or by turning one of the extreme flanks. Had the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7106","context":"Austrians succeeded in breaking through as far as Jaslo, Dmitrieff"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7107","context":"would have been cut off and Brussilov forced to withdraw--followed"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7108","context":"by the whole line. The same result would follow if a thrust from"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7109","context":"the Bukowina succeeded in recapturing Lemberg. Both methods had been"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7110","context":"attempted, and both had failed. Germany's overwhelming superiority"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7111","context":"in artillery could not be effectively displayed in mountain warfare,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7112","context":"but Dmitrieff's position on the Dunajec offered an easy avenue of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7115","context":"At the eleventh hour Dmitrieff grasped the situation and applied"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7116","context":"to Ivanoff for reenforcements. Owing to some blunder the appeal"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7117","context":"never reached the Russian chief, and Dmitrieff had to do the best"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7118","context":"he could. Nothing now could save his small force from those grim"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7119","context":"lines of gaping muzzles turned against his positions. The overture"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7120","context":"began on April 28, 1915, with an advance on the Upper Biala toward"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7121","context":"Gorlice, by Von Mackensen's right. Here some minor attacks had been"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7122","context":"previously made, and the gradually increasing pressure did not"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7123","context":"at first reveal the intent or magnitude of the movement behind it."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7124","context":"Meanwhile the German troops about Ciezkovice and Senkova--respectively"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7125","context":"northwest and southeast of Gorlice--were moving by night nearer to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7126","context":"the battle line. The Russian front line extended from Ciezkovice in"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7127","context":"a southeasterly direction. Hence it soon became clear that Gorlice"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7128","context":"itself was to be the main objective of the attack. A Russian official"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7129","context":"announcement of May 2, 1915, boldly states:"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7131","context":"\"During the nights of April 30 to May 1 strong Austrian forces"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7132","context":"opened an offensive in the region of Ciezkovice. Our fire forced the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7133","context":"enemy to intrench 600 paces in front of our trenches.\" Furthermore,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7134","context":"the Germans at the same time had directed artillery fire and bayonet"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7135","context":"attacks against various points on the Rava, Pilica, Nida, and the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7136","context":"Dunajec. These, however, were merely movements aiming at diversion,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7137","context":"meant to mask the intentions of the main attack and to mislead"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7138","context":"the Russians. On the evening of May 1, 1915, the German batteries"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7139","context":"began experimenting against the Russian positions. This was kept up"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7140","context":"all night while the engineers attempted to destroy the first line of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7141","context":"the Russian wire entanglements. During the same night the Austrians"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7142","context":"dragged several heavy howitzers across the road from Gladyszow to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7143","context":"Malastow, and got them into position without the knowledge of the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7144","context":"Russians. In the morning of May 2, 1915, the great batteries began"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7145","context":"to roar against the Russian line--a fire such as had perhaps never"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7146","context":"been witnessed before. A spectator thus describes the scene: \"In"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7147","context":"one part the whole area was covered with shells till trenches and"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7148","context":"men were leveled out of existence.\" It was reported that 700,000"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7149","context":"shells had been fired in the space of four hours, for which period"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7150","context":"this preliminary bombardment lasted. The Russian line was turned"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7151","context":"into a spluttering chaos of earth, stones, trees, and human bodies."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7152","context":"The German and Austrian batteries then proceeded to extend the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7153","context":"range, and poured a hurricane or shells behind the enemy's front"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7154","context":"line. This has the effect of doubly isolating that line, by which"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7155","context":"the survivors of the first bombardment cannot retreat, neither can"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7156","context":"reenforcements be sent to them, for no living being could pass"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7157","context":"through the fire curtain. Now is the time for the attacker's infantry"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7158","context":"to charge. Along the greater part of the Ciezkovice-Walastow line"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7159","context":"this stage was reached by ten o'clock in the morning or May 2,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7162","context":"A German writer tells us that \"in this part or the front infantry"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7163","context":"fighting has given place for the time being to the action of our"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7164","context":"heavy artillery, which is subjecting to a terrible fire the positions"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7165","context":"of the enemy. These positions had been carefully reconnoitered during"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7166","context":"the lull in the fighting which prevailed during the last few months."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7167","context":"Only after all cover is destroyed, the enemy's infantry killed or"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7168","context":"forced to retire, we take up the attack against the positions;"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7169","context":"the _élan_ of our first attack now usually leads to a favorable"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7172","context":"At Ciezkovice the Germans pushed bridges across the Biala under"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7173","context":"cover of a furious cannonade. Troops were thrown over, and after"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7174","context":"a very short struggle the village was taken. The huge oil tanks"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7175","context":"soon were in flames and Ciezkovice a heap of smoldering ruins."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7176","context":"The Russian defense crumpled up like smoke; their position blown"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7177","context":"out of existence. Their guns were toys compared with those or the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7178","context":"Germans and Austrians. North of Ciezkovice the Prussian Guard and"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7179","context":"other German troops under General von François fell upon the Russians"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7180","context":"and forced them to retire toward the Olpiny-Biecz line. The ground"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7181","context":"of the Russian positions on Mount Viatrovka and Mount Pustki in"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7182","context":"front of Biecz had been \"prepared\" by 21-centimeter (7-inch) Krupp"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7183","context":"howitzers and the giant Austrian 30.5-centimeter (10-inch) howitzers"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7184","context":"from the Skoda-Werke at Pilsen. The shells of the latter weigh"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7185","context":"nearly half a ton, and their impact is so terrific that they throw"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7186","context":"the earth up 100 feet high. Whatever had remained of the town of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7187","context":"Gorlice in the shape of buildings or human beings was meanwhile"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7188","context":"being wiped out by a merciless spray of shells. Being the center"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7189","context":"or an important oil district, Gorlice possessed oil wells, great"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7190","context":"refineries, and a sulphuric-acid factory. As the flames spread from"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7192","context":"of fire stretching heavenward from the oil wells in full blaze,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7193","context":"and, over all, the pitiless hail of iron and explosives pouring"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7194","context":"upon them, the horror of the situation in which the soldiers and"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7195","context":"civilians found themselves may be faintly imagined. Gorlice was an"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7196","context":"inferno in a few hours. When the German infantry dashed into the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7197","context":"town they found the Russians still in possession. Fighting hand"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7198","context":"to hand, contesting every step, the Russians were slowly driven"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7201","context":"We have mentioned that German troops were moving on Senkova, southeast"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7202","context":"of Gorlice, by night. During the last two days of April the Bavarians"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7203","context":"captured the Russian position in the Senkova valley. A further"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7204","context":"move was made here during the night of May 1-2, 1915, preparatory"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7205","context":"to dislodging the Russians from the ground they still held. At"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7206","context":"seven o'clock in the morning the big howitzers started to \"prepare\""}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7207","context":"that ground. By ten o'clock it was deemed that every living thing"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7208","context":"had perished, when the \"fire curtain\" was drawn behind the Russian"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7210","context":"To their intense astonishment they were received with a most murderous"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7211","context":"fire from Russian rifles, and machine guns. The first attack failed"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7212","context":"and many were killed, few getting beyond the wire entanglements."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7213","context":"Cautiously other troops advanced to the battered Russian trenches"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7214","context":"cut off from the rear by the artillery screen behind. Yet here"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7215","context":"again they met with strenuous resistance in the Zamczysko group of"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7216","context":"hills. The Austrian artillery shelled the heights, and the Bavarians"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7217","context":"finally took possession. The Tenth Austrian Army Corps had meanwhile"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7218","context":"conquered the Magora of Malastow and the majority of the heights"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7219","context":"in the Ostra Gora group. On Sunday, May 2, 1915, the Austro-German"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7220","context":"armies pierced the Dunajec-Biala line in several places, and by"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7221","context":"nightfall the Russians were retreating to their last hope--the line"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7222","context":"of the Wisloka. The operations round Gorlice on that day resulted"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7630","context":"the others, from Rostoki eastward, were held by the Austrians and"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7631","context":"Germans. It was through the Dukla and Lupkow that the Russians"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7659","context":"The Second Austro-Hungarian Army (Boehm-Ermolli) was fighting on"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7662","context":"Polena. We have stated elsewhere that the Forty-eighth Division"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7667","context":"his force safely out of the trap. Inch by inch the Russian rear"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_7668","context":"guards retreated, fighting tooth and nail to hold the pass while their"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_8421","context":"However, all attempts in this direction failed. The Russians gradually"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_8442","context":"eastward, but had to turn now right, now left, to help Austrian"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_8443","context":"and German commanders out of trouble. Heavy howitzers lumbered"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_8456","context":"Never were the fighting abilities of Slav and Teuton more severely"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_8457","context":"tested. For over a week the struggle raged; a half million men"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_8464","context":"drove into their ranks and advanced rapidly in a northerly direction"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_8465","context":"on its great flanking movement. But the Russian spirit was not"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_8466","context":"broken, for at this critical moment General Polodchenko rode out"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_8467","context":"with three regiments of cavalry--the Don Cossacks, the Chernigov"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_8468","context":"Hussars, and the Kimburn Dragoons. They dashed into the unbroken"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_8469","context":"lines of the triumphant German infantry like a living hurricane,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_8470","context":"sabered the enemy, and put thousands on the run. Swerving aside,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_8471","context":"they next charged deep into the German rear, mauled the reserves into"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_8472","context":"confusion, hacked their way out again and captured several machine"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_8473","context":"guns. The most remarkable feature about this extraordinary exploit"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_8474","context":"was the fact that the losses sustained by the cavalry amounted only"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_8475","context":"to 200 killed and wounded. The effect on the \"phalanx,\" however,"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_8476","context":"was such that no more attacks were made that day, and the Russians"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_8477","context":"were able to retire to the hills near Rawa-Ruska. Ivanoff was now"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_8478","context":"compelled to draw reenforcements from other parts of the line to"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_8479","context":"strengthen his front at Rawa-Ruska. This meant weakening Ewarts's"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_8485","context":"on the reasonable ground that, whatever precautions of defense he"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_8486","context":"might have taken, they would have proved ineffective against the"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_8489","context":"After the battle of Lubaczow the Russian line drew back about twenty"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_8497","context":"fifteen miles north of Grodek, where the level ground would permit"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_8498","context":"the easy transport of heavy artillery. This position had been fortified"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_8499","context":"with trenches and wire entanglements. Here also were concentrated"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_8500","context":"the troops withdrawn from other parts of the line, and four armored"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_10839","context":"At about that time another important military event occurred, especially"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_10840","context":"affecting the Balkans; the warships of the Entente began bombarding"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_10841","context":"the forts in the Dardanelles and it seemed that Constantinople was"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_10842","context":"presently to fall into their hands. Not long after Venizelos stated,"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_10847","context":"The Greek General Staff, however, immediately declined to support"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_10851","context":"of the Greek army operating against the Turks. Venizelos thereupon"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_10857","context":"Venizelos attempted to compromise, and here he was caught between"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_10858","context":"two obstacles. Bulgaria absolutely refused to recede one inch from"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_10859","context":"her demand; and, on the other hand, the Greek governing clique"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_10860","context":"suddenly refused to consider any proposal that would mean the cession"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_10861","context":"of any territory at all to the hated Bulgars. What probably stiffened"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_10863","context":"Turkish campaign was the growing suspicion on their part that the"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_10864","context":"Allies were also negotiating with Italy for her support. Now it"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_10865","context":"was obvious that if Italy was to fight in the Near East, she meant"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_10866","context":"to demand a good price. And this looked bad for Greece. Greece"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_10867","context":"and Italy had already nearly come to blows over their clashing"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_10868","context":"interests in southern Albania, yet even this was a small matter"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_10869","context":"compared to rivalry in the Ægean and Asia Minor. What deepened"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_10870","context":"these suspicions was the fact that the Allies refused to indicate"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_10871","context":"definitely just what territory Greece was to have in return for her"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_10872","context":"support against the Turks. Their promise of \"liberal compensation\""}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_10873","context":"was not at all definite enough. Only Venizelos was satisfied with"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_10874","context":"this promise; he was in favor of trusting implicitly to Anglo-French"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_10875","context":"gratitude."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_10877","context":"To bring this deadlock to a conclusion King Constantine called a"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_10878","context":"Royal Council, and by this body the matter was thoroughly discussed"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_10879","context":"during the first few days of March. The Council, together with"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_10880","context":"the king, decided against supporting the Allies actively on such"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_10885","context":"The fall of Venizelos was, naturally, a heavy blow to the Allies. He"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_10886","context":"was succeeded by Gounaris, an ex-Minister of Finance, who announced"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_10887","context":"his policy as one of strict neutrality. Venizelos was so deeply"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_10888","context":"mortified that he declared that he would withdraw permanently from"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_10899","context":"Serbia and Greece both protested loudly, but Bulgaria affirmed that"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_10900","context":"she had had nothing to do with the matter."}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_10902","context":"As has developed since, Bulgaria had by this time definitely decided"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_10904","context":"Already back in January, 1912, a secret treaty had been negotiated"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_10905","context":"between Bulgaria and Germany. This was signed a little later by"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_10906","context":"Prince Bülow and M. Rizoff at Rome. There were more reasons than"}
{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_10907","context":"one for keeping this secret. For within the Bulgarian Parliament"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_10917","context":"sent a reply, asking for further information, obviously drawn up"}

{"symbol":"bhagavad_gita_10921","context":"where he received a warm welcome from the populace, with whom he"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_100","context":"We take great pleasure in presenting to the attention of students and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_101","context":"investigators of the Secret Doctrines this little work based upon the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_102","context":"world-old Hermetic Teachings. There has been so little written upon this"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_103","context":"subject, not withstanding the countless references to the Teachings in"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_104","context":"the many works upon occultism, that the many earnest searchers after the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_105","context":"Arcane Truths will doubtless welcome the appearance of this present"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_108","context":"The purpose of this work is not the enunciation of any special"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_109","context":"philosophy or doctrine, but rather is to give to the students a"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_110","context":"statement of the Truth that will serve to reconcile the many bits of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_111","context":"occult knowledge that they may have acquired, but which are apparently"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_112","context":"opposed to each other and which often serve to discourage and disgust"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_113","context":"the beginner in the study. Our intent is not to erect a new Temple of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_114","context":"Knowledge, but rather to place in the hands of the student a Master-Key"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_115","context":"with which he may open the many inner doors in the Temple of Mystery"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_116","context":"through the main portals he has already entered."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_118","context":"There is no portion of the occult teachings possessed by the world which"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_119","context":"have been so closely guarded as the fragments of the Hermetic Teachings"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_120","context":"which have come down to us over the tens of centuries which have elapsed"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_121","context":"since the lifetime of its great founder, Hermes Trismegistus, the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_122","context":"\"scribe of the gods,\" who dwelt in old Egypt in the days when the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_123","context":"present race of men was in its infancy. Contemporary with Abraham, and,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_124","context":"if the legends be true, an instructor of that venerable sage, Hermes"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_125","context":"was, and is, the Great Central Sun of Occultism, whose rays have served"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_126","context":"to illumine the countless teachings which have been promulgated since"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_127","context":"his time. All the fundamental and basic teachings embedded in the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_128","context":"esoteric teachings of every race may be traced back to Hermes. Even the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_129","context":"most ancient teachings of India undoubtedly have their roots in the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_130","context":"original Hermetic Teachings."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_132","context":"From the land of the Ganges many advanced occultists wandered to the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_133","context":"land of Egypt, and sat at the feet of the Master. From him they obtained"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_134","context":"the Master-Key which explained and reconciled their divergent views, and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_135","context":"thus the Secret Doctrine was firmly established. From other lands also"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_136","context":"came the learned ones, all of whom regarded Hermes as the Master of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_137","context":"Masters, and his influence was so great that in spite of the many"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_138","context":"wanderings from the path on the part of the centuries of teachers in"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_139","context":"these different lands, there may still be found a certain basic"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_140","context":"resemblance and correspondence which underlies the many and often quite"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_141","context":"divergent theories entertained and taught by the occultists of these"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_142","context":"different lands today. The student of Comparative Religions will be able"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_143","context":"to perceive the influence of the Hermetic Teachings in every religion"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_144","context":"worthy of the name, now known to man, whether it be a dead religion or"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_145","context":"one in full vigor in our own times. There is always certain"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_146","context":"correspondence in spite of the contradictory features, and the Hermetic"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_147","context":"Teachings act as the Great Reconciler."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_149","context":"The lifework of Hermes seems to have been in the direction of planting"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_150","context":"the great Seed-Truth which has grown and blossomed in so many strange"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_151","context":"forms, rather than to establish a school of philosophy which would"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_152","context":"dominate, the world's thought. But, nevertheless, the original truths"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_153","context":"taught by him have been kept intact in their original purity by a few"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_154","context":"men each age, who, refusing great numbers of half-developed students and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_155","context":"followers, followed the Hermetic custom and reserved their truth for the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_156","context":"few who were ready to comprehend and master it. From lip to ear the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_157","context":"truth has been handed down among the few. There have always been a few"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_158","context":"Initiates in each generation, in the various lands of the earth, who"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_159","context":"kept alive the sacred flame of the Hermetic Teachings, and such have"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_160","context":"always been willing to use their lamps to re-light the lesser lamps of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_161","context":"the outside world, when the light of truth grew dim, and clouded by"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_162","context":"reason of neglect, and when the wicks became clogged with foreign"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_163","context":"matter. There were always a few to tend faithfully the altar of the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_164","context":"Truth, upon which was kept alight the Perpetual Lamp of Wisdom. These"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_165","context":"men devoted their lives to the labor of love which the poet has so well"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_166","context":"stated in his lines:"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_168","context":"     \"O, let not the flame die out! Cherished age after age"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_170","context":"     by pure ministers of love--let not the flame die out!\""}
{"symbol":"five_rings_172","context":"These men have never sought popular approval, nor numbers of followers."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_173","context":"They are indifferent to these things, for they know how few there are in"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_174","context":"each generation who are ready for the truth, or who would recognize it"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_175","context":"if it were presented to them. They reserve the \"strong meat for men,\""}
{"symbol":"five_rings_176","context":"while others furnish the \"milk for babes.\" They reserve their pearls of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_177","context":"wisdom for the few elect, who recognize their value and who wear them in"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_178","context":"their crowns, instead of casting them before the materialistic vulgar"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_179","context":"swine, who would trample them in the mud and mix them with their"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_180","context":"disgusting mental food. But still these men have never forgotten or"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_181","context":"overlooked the original teachings of Hermes, regarding the passing on of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_182","context":"the words of truth to those ready to receive it, which teaching is"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_183","context":"stated in The Kybalion as follows: \"Where fall the footsteps of the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_184","context":"Master, the ears of those ready for his Teaching open wide.\" And again:"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_185","context":"\"When the ears of the student are ready to hear, then cometh the lips to"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_186","context":"fill them with wisdom.\" But their customary attitude has always been"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_187","context":"strictly in accordance with the other Hermetic aphorism, also in The"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_188","context":"Kybalion: \"The lips of Wisdom are closed, except to the ears of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_189","context":"Understanding.\""}
{"symbol":"five_rings_191","context":"There are those who have criticized this attitude of the Hermetists, and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_192","context":"who have claimed that they did not manifest the proper spirit in their"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_193","context":"policy of seclusion and reticence. But a moment's glance back over the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_194","context":"pages of history will show the wisdom of the Masters, who knew the folly"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_195","context":"of attempting to teach to the world that which it was neither ready or"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_196","context":"willing to receive. The Hermetists have never sought to be martyrs, and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_197","context":"have, instead, sat silently aside with a pitying smile on their closed"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_198","context":"lips, while the \"heathen raged noisily about them\" in their customary"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_199","context":"amusement of putting to death and torture the honest but misguided"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_200","context":"enthusiasts who imagined that they could force upon a race of barbarians"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_201","context":"the truth capable of being understood only by the elect who had advanced"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_202","context":"along The Path."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_204","context":"And the spirit of persecution has not as yet died out in the land. There"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_205","context":"are certain Hermetic Teachings, which, if publicly promulgated, would"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_206","context":"bring down upon the teachers a great cry of scorn and revilement from"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_207","context":"the multitude, who would again raise the cry of \"Crucify! Crucify.\""}

{"symbol":"five_rings_229","context":"which have so strongly influenced the philosophies of all races, nations"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_230","context":"and peoples, for several thousand years. Egypt, the home of the Pyramids"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_240","context":"In ancient Egypt dwelt the great Adepts and Masters who have never been"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_242","context":"have taken their processional flight since the days of the Great Hermes."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_243","context":"In Egypt was located the Great Lodge of Lodges of the Mystics. At the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_244","context":"doors of her Temples entered the Neophytes who afterward, as"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_245","context":"Hierophants, Adepts, and Masters, traveled to the four corners of the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_246","context":"earth, carrying with them the precious knowledge which they were ready,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_247","context":"anxious, and willing to pass on to those who were ready to receive the"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_249","context":"these venerable Masters of that ancient land."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_251","context":"But among these great Masters of Ancient Egypt there once dwelt one of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_252","context":"whom Masters hailed as \"The Master of Masters.\" This man, if \"man\""}
{"symbol":"five_rings_253","context":"indeed he was, dwelt in Egypt in the earliest days. He was known as"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_254","context":"Hermes Trismegistus. He was the father of the Occult Wisdom; the founder"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_255","context":"of Astrology; the discoverer of Alchemy. The details of his life story"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_256","context":"are lost to history, owing to the lapse of the years, though several of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_257","context":"the ancient countries disputed with each other in their claims to the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_258","context":"honor of having furnished his birthplace--and this thousands of years"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_259","context":"ago. The date of his sojourn in Egypt, in that his last incarnation on"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_260","context":"this planet, is not now known, but it has been fixed at the early days"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_261","context":"of the oldest dynasties of Egypt--long before the days of Moses. The"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_262","context":"best authorities regard him as a contemporary of Abraham, and some of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_263","context":"the Jewish traditions go so far as to claim that Abraham acquired a"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_264","context":"portion of his mystic knowledge from Hermes himself."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_266","context":"As the years rolled by after his passing from this plane of life"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_267","context":"(tradition recording that he lived three hundred years in the flesh),"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_268","context":"the Egyptians deified Hermes, and made him one of their gods, under the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_269","context":"name of Thoth. Years after, the people of Ancient Greece also made him"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_270","context":"one of their many gods--calling him \"Hermes, the god of Wisdom.\" The"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_271","context":"Egyptians revered his memory for many centuries-yes, tens of centuries--"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_272","context":"calling him \"the Scribe of the Gods,\" and bestowing upon him,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_273","context":"distinctively, his ancient title, \"Trismegistus,\" which means \"the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_274","context":"thrice-great\"; \"the great-great\"; \"the greatest-great\"; etc. In all the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_275","context":"ancient lands, the name of Hermes Trismegistus was revered, the name"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_276","context":"being synonymous with the \"Fount of Wisdom.\""}
{"symbol":"five_rings_278","context":"Even to this day, we use the term \"hermetic\" in the sense of \"secret\";"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_279","context":"\"sealed so that nothing can escape\"; etc., and this by reason of the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_280","context":"fact that the followers of Hermes always observed the principle of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_281","context":"secrecy in their teachings. They did not believe in \"casting pearls"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_282","context":"before swine,\" but rather held to the teaching \"milk for babes\"; \"meat"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_283","context":"for strong men,\" both of which maxims are familiar to readers of the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_284","context":"Christian scriptures, but both of which had been used by the Egyptians"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_285","context":"for centuries before the Christian era."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_287","context":"And this policy of careful dissemination of the truth has always"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_288","context":"characterized the Hermetics, even unto the present day. The Hermetic"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_289","context":"Teachings are to be found in all lands, among all religions, but never"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_290","context":"identified with any particular country, nor with any particular"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_291","context":"religious sect. This because of the warning of the ancient teachers"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_292","context":"against allowing the Secret Doctrine to become crystallized into a"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_293","context":"creed. The wisdom of this caution is apparent to all students of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_294","context":"history. The ancient occultism of India and Persia degenerated, and was"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_295","context":"largely lost, owing to the fact that the teachers became priests, and so"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_296","context":"mixed theology with the philosophy, the result being that the occultism"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_297","context":"of India and Persia has been gradually lost amidst the mass of religious"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_298","context":"superstition, cults, creeds and \"gods.\" So it was with Ancient Greece"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_299","context":"and Rome. So it was with the Hermetic Teachings of the Gnostics and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_300","context":"Early Christians, which were lost at the time of Constantine, whose iron"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_301","context":"hand smothered philosophy with the blanket of theology, losing to the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_302","context":"Christian Church that which was its very essence and spirit, and causing"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_303","context":"it to grope throughout several centuries before it found the way back to"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_304","context":"its ancient faith, the indications apparent to all careful observers in"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_305","context":"this Twentieth Century being that the Church is now struggling to get"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_306","context":"back to its ancient mystic teachings."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_308","context":"But there were always a few faithful souls who kept alive the Flame,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_309","context":"tending it carefully, and not allowing its light to become extinguished."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_310","context":"And thanks to these staunch hearts, and fearless minds, we have the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_311","context":"truth still with us.  But it is not found in books, to any great extent."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_312","context":"It has been passed along from Master to Student; from Initiate to"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_313","context":"Hierophant; from lip to ear. When it was written down at all, its"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_314","context":"meaning was veiled in terms of alchemy and astrology so that only those"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_315","context":"possessing the key could read it aright. This was made necessary in"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_316","context":"order to avoid the persecutions of the theologians of the Middle Ages,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_317","context":"who fought the Secret Doctrine with fire and sword; stake, gibbet and"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_380","context":"THE SEVEN HERMETIC PRINCIPLES"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_382","context":"    \"The Principles of Truth are Seven; he who knows these,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_383","context":"    understandingly, possesses the Magic Key before whose"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_384","context":"    touch all the Doors of the Temple fly open.\"--The Kybalion."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_386","context":"The Seven Hermetic Principles, upon which the entire Hermetic Philosophy"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_387","context":"is based, are as follows:"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_389","context":"    1. The Principle of Mentalism."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_390","context":"    2. The Principle of Correspondence."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_391","context":"    3. The Principle of Vibration."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_392","context":"    4. The Principle of Polarity."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_393","context":"    5. The Principle of Rhythm."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_394","context":"    6. The Principle of Cause and Effect."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_395","context":"    7. The Principle of Gender."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_397","context":"These Seven Principles will be discussed and explained as we proceed"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_398","context":"with these lessons. A short explanation of each, however, may as well be"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_399","context":"given at this point."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_401","context":"1.  The Principle of Mentalism"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_403","context":"    \"THE ALL IS MIND; The Universe is Mental.\"--The Kybalion."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_405","context":"This Principle embodies the truth that \"All is Mind.\" It explains that"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_406","context":"THE ALL (which is the Substantial Reality underlying all the outward"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_407","context":"manifestations and appearances which we know under the terms of \"The"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_408","context":"Material Universe\"; the \"Phenomena of Life\"; \"Matter\"; \"Energy\"; and, in"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_409","context":"short, all that is apparent to our material senses) is SPIRIT which in"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_410","context":"itself is UNKNOWABLE and UNDEFINABLE, but which may be considered and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_411","context":"thought of as AN UNIVERSAL, INFINITE, LIVING MIND. It also explains that"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_412","context":"all the phenomenal world or universe is simply a Mental Creation of THE"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_413","context":"ALL, subject to the Laws of Created Things, and that the universe, as a"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_414","context":"whole, and in its parts or units, has its existence in the Mind of THE"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_415","context":"ALL, in which Mind we \"live and move and have our being.\" This"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_416","context":"Principle, by establishing the Mental Nature of the Universe, easily"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_417","context":"explains all of the varied mental and psychic phenomena that occupy such"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_418","context":"a large portion of the public attention, and which, without such"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_419","context":"explanation, are non-understandable and defy scientific treatment. An"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_420","context":"understanding of this great Hermetic Principle of Mentalism enables the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_421","context":"individual to readily grasp the laws of the Mental Universe, and to"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_422","context":"apply the same to his well-being and advancement. The Hermetic Student"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_423","context":"is enabled to apply intelligently the great Mental Laws, instead of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_424","context":"using them in a haphazard manner. With the Master-Key in his possession,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_425","context":"the student may unlock the many doors of the mental and psychic temple"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_426","context":"of knowledge, and enter the same freely and intelligently. This"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_427","context":"Principle explains the true nature of \"Energy,\" \"Power,\" and \"Matter,\""}
{"symbol":"five_rings_428","context":"and why and how all these are subordinate to the Mastery of Mind. One of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_429","context":"the old Hermetic Masters wrote, long ages ago: \"He who grasps the truth"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_430","context":"of the Mental Nature of the Universe is well advanced on The Path to"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_431","context":"Mastery.\" And these words are as true today as at the time they were"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_432","context":"first written. Without this Master-Key, Mastery is impossible, and the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_433","context":"student knocks in vain at the many doors of The Temple."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_435","context":"2.  The Principle of Correspondence"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_437","context":"    \"As above, so below; as below, so above.\"--The Kybalion."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_439","context":"This Principle embodies the truth that there is always a Correspondence"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_440","context":"between the laws and phenomena of the various planes of Being and Life."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_441","context":"The old Hermetic axiom ran in these words: \"As above, so below; as"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_442","context":"below, so above.\" And the grasping of this Principle gives one the means"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_443","context":"of solving many a dark paradox, and hidden secret of Nature. There are"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_444","context":"planes beyond our knowing, but when we apply the Principle of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_445","context":"Correspondence to them we are able to understand much that would"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_446","context":"otherwise be unknowable to us. This Principle is of universal"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_447","context":"application and manifestation, on the various planes of the material,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_448","context":"mental, and spiritual universe--it is an Universal Law. The ancient"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_449","context":"Hermetists considered this Principle as one of the most important mental"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_450","context":"instruments by which man was able to pry aside the obstacles which hid"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_451","context":"from view the Unknown. Its use even tore aside the Veil of Isis to the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_452","context":"extent that a glimpse of the face of the goddess might be caught. Just"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_453","context":"as a knowledge of the Principles of Geometry enables man to measure"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_454","context":"distant suns and their movements, while seated in his observatory,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_455","context":"so a knowledge of the Principle of Correspondence enables Man to reason"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_456","context":"intelligently from the Known to the Unknown.  Studying the monad, he"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_457","context":"understands the archangel."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_459","context":"3.  The Principle of Vibration"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_461","context":"    \"Nothing rests; everything moves; everything vibrates.\"--The"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_462","context":"    Kybalion."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_464","context":"This Principle embodies the truth that \"everything is in motion\";"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_465","context":"\"everything vibrates\"; \"nothing is at rest\"; facts which Modern Science"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_466","context":"endorses, and which each new scientific discovery tends to verify.  And"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_467","context":"yet this Hermetic Principle was enunciated thousands of years ago, by"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_468","context":"the Masters of Ancient Egypt. This Principle explains that the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_469","context":"differences between different manifestations of Matter, Energy, Mind,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_470","context":"and even Spirit, result largely from varying rates of Vibration. From"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_471","context":"THE ALL, which is Pure Spirit, down to the grossest form of Matter, all"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_472","context":"is in vibration--the higher the vibration, the higher the position in"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_473","context":"the scale. The vibration of Spirit is at such an infinite rate of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_474","context":"intensity and rapidity that it is practically at rest--just as a rapidly"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_475","context":"moving wheel seems to be motionless. And at the other end of the scale,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_476","context":"there are gross forms of matter whose vibrations are so low as to seem"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_477","context":"at rest. Between these poles, there are millions upon millions of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_478","context":"varying degrees of vibration. From corpuscle and electron, atom and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_479","context":"molecule, to worlds and universes, everything is in vibratory motion."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_480","context":"This is also true on the planes of energy and force (which are but"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_481","context":"varying degrees of vibration); and also on the mental planes (whose"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_482","context":"states depend upon vibrations); and even on to the spiritual planes."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_483","context":"An understanding of this Principle, with the appropriate formulas,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_484","context":"enables Hermetic students to control their own mental vibrations as well"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_485","context":"as those of others. The Masters also apply this Principle to the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_486","context":"conquering of Natural phenomena, in various ways. \"He who understands"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_487","context":"the Principle of Vibration, has grasped the scepter of power,\" says one"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_488","context":"of the old writers."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_490","context":"4.  The Principle of Polarity"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_492","context":"    \"Everything is Dual; everything has poles; everything has its"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_493","context":"    pair of opposites; like and unlike are the same; opposites are"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_494","context":"    identical in nature, but different in degree; extremes meet;"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_495","context":"    all truths are but half-truths; all paradoxes may be"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_496","context":"    reconciled.\"--The Kybalion."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_498","context":"This Principle embodies the truth that \"everything is dual\"; \"everything"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_499","context":"has two poles\"; \"everything has its pair of opposites,\" all of which"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_500","context":"were old Hermetic axioms. It explains the old paradoxes, that have"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_501","context":"perplexed so many, which have been stated as follows: \"Thesis and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_502","context":"antithesis are identical in nature, but different in degree\"; \"opposites"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_503","context":"are the same, differing only in degree\"; \"the pairs of opposites may be"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_504","context":"reconciled\"; \"extremes meet\"; \"everything is and isn't, at the same"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_505","context":"time\"; \"all truths are but half-truths\"; \"every truth is half-false\";"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_506","context":"\"there are two sides to everything,\" etc., etc., etc. It explains that"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_507","context":"in everything there are two poles, or opposite aspects, and that"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_508","context":"\"opposites\" are really only the two extremes of the same thing, with"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_509","context":"many varying degrees between them. To illustrate:  Heat and Cold,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_510","context":"although \"opposites,\" are really the same thing, the differences"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_511","context":"consisting merely of degrees of the same thing. Look at your thermometer"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_512","context":"and see if you can discover where \"heat\" terminates and \"cold\" begins!"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_513","context":"There is no such thing as \"absolute heat\" or \"absolute cold\"--the two"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_514","context":"terms \"heat\" and \"cold\" simply indicate varying degrees of the same"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_515","context":"thing, and that \"same thing\" which manifests as \"heat\" and \"cold\""}
{"symbol":"five_rings_516","context":"is merely a form, variety, and rate of Vibration. So \"heat\" and \"cold\""}
{"symbol":"five_rings_517","context":"are simply the \"two poles\" of that which we call \"Heat\"--and the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_518","context":"phenomena attendant thereupon are manifestations of the Principle of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_519","context":"Polarity. The same Principle manifests in the case of \"Light and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_520","context":"Darkness,\" which are the same thing, the difference consisting of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_521","context":"varying degrees between the two poles of the phenomena. Where does"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_522","context":"\"darkness\" leave off, and \"light\" begin? What is the difference between"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_523","context":"\"Large and Small\"? Between \"Hard and Soft\"? Between \"Black and White\"?"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_524","context":"Between \"Sharp and Dull\"? Between \"Noise and Quiet\"? Between \"High and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_525","context":"Low\"? Between \"Positive and Negative\"? The Principle of Polarity"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_526","context":"explains these paradoxes, and no other Principle can supersede it. The"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_527","context":"same Principle operates on the Mental Plane. Let us take a radical and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_528","context":"extreme example--that of \"Love and Hate,\" two mental states apparently"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_529","context":"totally different.  And yet there are degrees of Hate and degrees of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_530","context":"Love, and a middle point in which we use the terms \"Like or Dislike,\""}
{"symbol":"five_rings_531","context":"which shade into each other so gradually that sometimes we are at a loss"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_532","context":"to know whether we \"like\" or \"dislike\" or \"neither.\" And all are simply"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_533","context":"degrees of the same thing, as you will see if you will but think a"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_534","context":"moment.  And, more than this (and considered of more importance"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_535","context":"by the Hermetists), it is possible to change the vibrations of Hate to"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_536","context":"the vibrations of Love, in one's own mind, and in the minds of others."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_537","context":"Many of you, who read these lines, have had personal experiences of the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_538","context":"involuntary rapid transition from Love to Hate, and the reverse, in your"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_539","context":"own case and that of others.  And you will therefore realize the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_540","context":"possibility of this being accomplished by the use of the Will, by means"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_541","context":"of the Hermetic formulas. \"Good and Evil\" are but the poles of the same"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_542","context":"thing, and the Hermetist understands the art of transmuting Evil into"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_543","context":"Good, by means of an application of the Principle of Polarity. In short,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_544","context":"the \"Art of Polarization\" becomes a phase of \"Mental Alchemy\" known and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_545","context":"practiced by the ancient and modern Hermetic Masters.  An understanding"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_546","context":"of the Principle will enable one to change his own Polarity, as well as"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_547","context":"that of others, if he will devote the time and study necessary to master"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_550","context":"5.  The Principle of Rhythm"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_552","context":"    \"Everything flows, out and in; everything has its tides;"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_553","context":"    all things rise and fall; the pendulum-swing manifests in"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_554","context":"    everything; the measure of the swing to the right is the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_555","context":"    measure of the swing to the left; rhythm compensates.\"--The"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_556","context":"    Kybalion."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_558","context":"This Principle embodies the truth that in everything there is manifested"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_559","context":"a measured motion, to and fro; a flow and inflow; a swing backward and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_560","context":"forward; a pendulum-like movement; a tide-like ebb and flow; a high-tide"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_561","context":"and low-tide; between the two poles which exist in accordance with the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_562","context":"Principle of Polarity described a moment ago. There is always an action"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_563","context":"and a reaction; an advance and a retreat; a rising and a sinking. This"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_564","context":"is in the affairs of the Universe, suns, worlds, men, animals, mind,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_565","context":"energy, and matter.  This law is manifest in the creation and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_566","context":"destruction of worlds; in the rise and fall of nations; in the life of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_567","context":"all things; and finally in the mental states of Man (and it is with this"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_568","context":"latter that the Hermetists find the understanding of the Principle most"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_569","context":"important). The Hermetists have grasped this Principle, finding its"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_570","context":"universal application, and have also discovered certain means to"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_571","context":"overcome its effects in themselves by the use of the appropriate"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_572","context":"formulas and methods. They apply the Mental Law of Neutralization. They"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_573","context":"cannot annul the Principle, or cause it to cease its operation, but they"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_574","context":"have learned how to escape its effects upon themselves to a certain"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_575","context":"degree depending upon the Mastery of the Principle.  They have learned"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_576","context":"how to USE it, instead of being USED BY it. In this and similar"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_577","context":"methods, consist the Art of the Hermetists. The Master of Hermetics"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_578","context":"polarizes himself at the point at which he desires to rest, and then"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_579","context":"neutralizes the Rhythmic swing of the pendulum which would tend to carry"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_580","context":"him to the other pole.  All individuals who have attained any degree of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_581","context":"Self-Mastery do this to a certain degree, more or less unconsciously,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_582","context":"but the Master does this consciously, and by the use of his Will, and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_583","context":"attains a degree of Poise and Mental Firmness almost impossible of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_584","context":"belief on the part of the masses who are swung backward and forward like"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_585","context":"a pendulum. This Principle and that of Polarity have been closely"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_586","context":"studied by the Hermetists, and the methods of counteracting,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_587","context":"neutralizing, and USING them form an important part of the Hermetic"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_588","context":"Mental Alchemy."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_590","context":"6.  The Principle of Cause and Effect"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_592","context":"    \"Every Cause has its Effect; every Effect has its Cause;"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_593","context":"    everything happens according to Law; Chance is but a name"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_594","context":"    for Law not recognized; there are many planes of causation,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_595","context":"    but nothing escapes the Law.\"--The Kybalion."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_597","context":"This Principle embodies the fact that there is a Cause for every Effect;"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_598","context":"an Effect from every Cause. It explains that:  \"Everything Happens"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_599","context":"according to Law\"; that nothing ever \"merely happens\"; that there is no"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_600","context":"such thing as Chance; that while there are various planes of Cause and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_601","context":"Effect, the higher dominating the lower planes, still nothing ever"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_602","context":"entirely escapes the Law. The Hermetists understand the art and methods"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_603","context":"of rising above the ordinary plane of Cause and Effect, to a certain"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_604","context":"degree, and by mentally rising to a higher plane they become Causers"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_605","context":"instead of Effects. The masses of people are carried along, obedient to"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_606","context":"environment; the wills and desires of others stronger than themselves;"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_607","context":"heredity; suggestion; and other outward causes moving them about like"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_608","context":"pawns on the Chessboard of Life. But the Masters, rising to the plane"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_609","context":"above, dominate their moods, characters, qualities, and powers, as well"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_610","context":"as the environment surrounding them, and become Movers instead of pawns."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_611","context":"They help to PLAY THE GAME OF LIFE, instead of being played and moved"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_612","context":"about by other wills and environment. They USE the Principle instead of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_613","context":"being its tools. The Masters obey the Causation of the higher planes,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_614","context":"but they help to RULE on their own plane. In this statement there is"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_615","context":"condensed a wealth of Hermetic knowledge--let him read who can."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_617","context":"7.  The Principle of Gender"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_619","context":"    \"Gender is in everything; everything has its Masculine"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_620","context":"    and Feminine Principles; Gender manifests on all"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_621","context":"    planes.\"--The Kybalion."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_623","context":"This Principle embodies the truth that there is GENDER manifested in"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_624","context":"everything--the Masculine and Feminine Principles ever at work. This is"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_625","context":"true not only of the Physical Plane, but of the Mental and even the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_626","context":"Spiritual Planes. On the Physical Plane, the Principle manifests as SEX,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_627","context":"on the higher planes it takes higher forms, but the Principle is ever"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_628","context":"the same.  No creation, physical, mental or spiritual, is possible"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_629","context":"without this Principle. An understanding of its laws will throw light on"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_630","context":"many a subject that has perplexed the minds of men. The Principle of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_631","context":"Gender works ever in the direction of generation, regeneration, and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_632","context":"creation. Everything, and every person, contains the two Elements or"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_633","context":"Principles, or this great Principle, within it, him or her. Every Male"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_634","context":"thing has the Female Element also; every Female contains also the Male"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_635","context":"Principle.  If you would understand the philosophy of Mental and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_636","context":"Spiritual Creation, Generation, and Re-generation, you must understand"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_637","context":"and study this Hermetic Principle. It contains the solution of many"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_638","context":"mysteries of Life. We caution you that this Principle has no reference"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_639","context":"to the many base, pernicious and degrading lustful theories, teachings"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_640","context":"and practices, which are taught under fanciful titles, and which are a"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_641","context":"prostitution of the great natural principle of Gender. Such base"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_642","context":"revivals of the ancient infamous forms of Phallicism tend to ruin mind,"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_644","context":"note against these degraded teachings which tend toward lust,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_645","context":"licentiousness, and perversion of Nature's principles. If you seek such"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_646","context":"teachings, you must go elsewhere for them--Hermeticism contains nothing"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_719","context":"Transmutation is really the \"Magic\" of which the ancient; writers had so"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_720","context":"much to say in their mystical works, and about which they gave so few"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_1004","context":"We must either do this or stop thinking of the matter at all."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1006","context":"Let us now proceed to a consideration of the nature of the Universe, as"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1007","context":"a whole and in its parts. What is the Universe? We have seen that there"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1008","context":"can be nothing outside of THE ALL. Then is the Universe THE ALL? No,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1009","context":"this cannot be, because the Universe seems to be made up of MANY, and is"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1010","context":"constantly changing, and in other ways it does not measure up to the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1011","context":"ideas that we are compelled to accept regarding THE ALL, as stated in"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1012","context":"our last lesson. Then if the Universe be not THE ALL, then it must be"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1013","context":"Nothing--such is the inevitable conclusion of the mind at first thought."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1014","context":"But this will not satisfy the question, for we are sensible of the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1015","context":"existence of the Universe. Then if the Universe is neither THE ALL, nor"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1016","context":"Nothing, what Can it be? Let us examine this question."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1018","context":"If the Universe exists at all, or seems to exist, it must proceed in"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1019","context":"some way from THE ALL--it must be a creation of THE ALL. But as"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1020","context":"something can never come from nothing, from what could THE ALL have"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1021","context":"created it. Some philosophers have answered this question by saying that"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1022","context":"THE ALL created the Universe from ITSELF--that is, from the being and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1023","context":"substance of THE ALL. But this will not do, for THE ALL cannot be"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1024","context":"subtracted from, nor divided, as we have seen, and then again if this be"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1025","context":"so, would not each particle in the Universe be aware of its being THE"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1026","context":"ALL--THE ALL could not lose its knowledge of itself, nor actually BECOME"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1027","context":"an atom, or blind force, or lowly living thing. Some men, indeed,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1028","context":"realizing that THE ALL is indeed ALL, and also recognizing that they,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1029","context":"the men, existed, have jumped to the conclusion that they and THE ALL"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1030","context":"were identical, and they have filled the air with shouts of \"I AM GOD,\""}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1031","context":"to the amusement of the multitude and the sorrow of sages. The claim of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1032","context":"the corpuscle that: \"I am Man!\" would be modest in comparison."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1034","context":"But, what indeed is the Universe, if it be not THE ALL, not yet created"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1035","context":"by THE ALL having separated itself into fragments? What else can it be--"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1036","context":"of what else can it be made? This is the great question. Let us examine"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1037","context":"it carefully. We find here that the \"Principle of Correspondence\" (see"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1038","context":"Lesson I.) comes to our aid here. The old Hermetic axiom, \"As above so"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1039","context":"below,\" may be pressed into service at this point. Let us endeavor to"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1040","context":"get a glimpse of the workings on higher planes by examining those on our"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1041","context":"own. The Principle of Correspondence must apply to this as well as to"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1042","context":"other problems."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1044","context":"Let us see! On his own plane of being, how does Man create? Well, first,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1045","context":"he may create by making something out of outside materials. But this"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1046","context":"will not do, for there are no materials outside of THE ALL with which it"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1047","context":"may create. Well, then, secondly, Man pro-creates or reproduces his kind"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1048","context":"by the process of begetting, which is self-multiplication accomplished"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1049","context":"by transferring a portion of his substance to his offspring. But this"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1050","context":"will not do, because THE ALL cannot transfer or subtract a portion of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1051","context":"itself, nor can it reproduce or multiply itself--in the first place"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1052","context":"there would be a taking away, and in the second case a multiplication or"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1053","context":"addition to THE ALL, both thoughts being an absurdity. Is there no third"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1054","context":"way in which MAN creates? Yes, there is--he CREATES MENTALLY! And in so"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1055","context":"doing he uses no outside materials, nor does he reproduce himself, and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1056","context":"yet his Spirit pervades the Mental Creation."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1058","context":"Following the Principle of Correspondence, we are justified in"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1059","context":"considering that THE ALL creates the Universe MENTALLY, in a manner akin"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1060","context":"to the process whereby Man creates Mental Images. And, here is where the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1061","context":"report of Reason tallies precisely with the report of the Illumined, as"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1062","context":"shown by their teachings and writings. Such are the teachings of the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1063","context":"Wise Men. Such was the Teaching of Hermes."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1065","context":"THE ALL can create in no other way except mentally, without either using"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1066","context":"material (and there is none to use), or else reproducing itself (which"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1067","context":"is also impossible). There is no escape from this conclusion of the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1068","context":"Reason, which, as we have said, agrees with the highest teachings of the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1069","context":"Illumined. Just as you, student, may create a Universe of your own in"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1070","context":"your mentality, so does THE ALL create Universes in its own Mentality."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1071","context":"But your Universe is the mental creation of a Finite Mind, whereas that"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1072","context":"of THE ALL is the creation of an Infinite. The two are similar in kind,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1073","context":"but infinitely different in degree. We shall examine more closely into"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_1088","context":"as we have said before, \"Gender\" does not mean \"Sex\" sex is merely a"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1089","context":"material manifestation of gender. \"Gender\" means \"relating to generation"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1090","context":"or creation.\" And whenever anything is generated or created, on any"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1091","context":"plane, the Principle of Gender must be manifested. And this is true even"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1092","context":"in the creation of Universes."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1094","context":"Now do not jump to the conclusion that we are teaching that there is a"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1095","context":"male and female God, or Creator. That idea is merely a distortion of the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1096","context":"ancient teachings on the subject. The true teaching is that THE ALL, in"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1097","context":"itself, is above Gender, as it is above every other Law, including those"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1098","context":"of Time and Space. It is the Law, from which the Laws proceed, and it is"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1099","context":"not subject to them. But when THE ALL manifests on the plane of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1100","context":"generation or creation, then it acts according to Law and Principle, for"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1101","context":"it is moving on a lower plane of Being. And consequently it manifests"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1102","context":"the Principle of Gender, in its Masculine and Feminine aspects, on the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1103","context":"Mental Plane, of course."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1105","context":"This idea may seem startling to some of you who hear it for the first"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1106","context":"time, but you have all really passively accepted it in your everyday"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1107","context":"conceptions. You speak of the Fatherhood of God, and the Motherhood of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1108","context":"Nature--of God, the Divine Father, and Nature the Universal Mother--and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1109","context":"have thus instinctively acknowledged the Principle of Gender in the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1110","context":"Universe. Is this not so?"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1112","context":"But, the Hermetic teaching does not imply a real duality--THE ALL is"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1113","context":"ONE--the Two Aspects are merely aspects of manifestation. The teaching"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1114","context":"is that The Masculine Principle manifested by THE ALL stands, in a way,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1115","context":"apart from the actual mental creation of the Universe. It projects its"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_1378","context":"thousands of years ago, and who later incarnated as Heraclitus, the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1379","context":"Grecian philosopher who lived B. C. 500. And they regard his statement"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_1381","context":"Hermetic Teachings, always with the addition of their own doctrine"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1382","context":"that his \"Energy\" is the Energy of the Mind of THE ALL. With the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1383","context":"Master-Key of the Hermetic Philosophy, the student of Spencer will be"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1384","context":"able to unlock many doors of the inner philosophical conceptions of the"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_1390","context":"So, the student of Hermetics need not lay aside any of his cherished"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_1403","context":"its search for Reality."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1405","context":"The purpose of this lesson is to impress upon the minds of our students"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1406","context":"the fact that, to all intents and purposes, the Universe and its laws,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1407","context":"and its phenomena, are just as REAL, so far as Man is concerned, as they"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1408","context":"would be under the hypotheses of Materialism or Energism. Under any"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1409","context":"hypothesis the Universe in its outer aspect is changing, ever-flowing,"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_1411","context":"(note the other pole of the truth) under the same hypotheses, we are"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1412","context":"compelled to ACT AND LIVE as if the fleeting things were real and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1413","context":"substantial. With this difference, always, between the various"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1414","context":"hypotheses--that under the old views Mental Power was ignored as a"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1415","context":"Natural Force, while under Mentalism it becomes the Greatest Natural"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1416","context":"Force. And this one difference revolutionizes Life, to those who"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1417","context":"understand the Principle and its resulting laws and practice."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1419","context":"So, finally, students all, grasp the advantage of Mentalism, and learn"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_1489","context":"statement is usually illustrated by the Teachers by a reference to the"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_1494","context":"an ideal that he wishes to express by his art. In each case, the student"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1495","context":"will find that while the image has its existence, and being, solely"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1496","context":"within his own mind, yet he, the student, author, dramatist, painter, or"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1497","context":"sculptor, is, in a sense, immanent in; remaining within; or abiding"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1498","context":"within, the mental image also. In other words, the entire virtue, life,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1499","context":"spirit, of reality in the mental image is derived from the \"immanent"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_1503","context":"To take a modern example, let us say that Othello, Iago, Hamlet, Lear,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1504","context":"Richard III, existed merely in the mind of Shakespeare, at the time of"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_1632","context":"that comes very near to an invasion of the Metaphysical field of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1633","context":"speculation, although our purpose is merely to show the futility of such"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1634","context":"speculation. We allude to the question which inevitably comes to the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1635","context":"mind of all thinkers who have ventured to seek the Truth. The question"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1636","context":"is: \"WHY does THE ALL create Universes\" The question may be asked in"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1637","context":"different forms, but the above is the gist of the inquiry."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1639","context":"Men have striven hard to answer this question, but still there is no"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1640","context":"answer worthy of the name. Some have imagined that THE ALL had something"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1641","context":"to gain by it, but this is absurd, for what could THE ALL gain that it"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1642","context":"did not already possess? Others have sought the answer in the idea that"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1643","context":"THE ALL \"wished something to love\" and others that it created for"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1644","context":"pleasure, or amusement; or because it \"was lonely\" or to manifest its"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1645","context":"power;--all puerile explanations and ideas, belonging to the childish"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1646","context":"period of thought."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1648","context":"Others have sought to explain the mystery by assuming that THE ALL found"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1649","context":"itself \"compelled\" to create, by reason of its own \"internal"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1650","context":"nature\"--its \"creative instinct.\" This idea is in advance of the others,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1651","context":"but its weak point lies in the idea of THE ALL being \"compelled\" by"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1652","context":"anything, internal or external. If its \"internal nature,\" or \"creative"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1653","context":"instinct,\" compelled it to do anything, then the \"internal nature\" or"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1654","context":"\"creative instinct\" would be the Absolute, instead of THE ALL, and so"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1655","context":"accordingly that part of the proposition falls. And, yet, THE ALL does"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1656","context":"create and manifest, and seems to find some kind of satisfaction in so"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1657","context":"doing. And it is difficult to escape the conclusion that in some"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1658","context":"infinite degree it must have what would correspond to an \"inner nature,\""}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1659","context":"or \"creative instinct,\" in man, with correspondingly infinite Desire and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1660","context":"Will. It could not act unless it Willed to Act; and it would not Will to"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1661","context":"Act, unless it Desired to Act and it would not Desire to Act unless it"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1662","context":"obtained some Satisfaction thereby. And all of these things would belong"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1663","context":"to an \"Inner Nature,\" and might be postulated as existing according to"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1664","context":"the Law of Correspondence. But, still, we prefer to think of THE ALL as"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1665","context":"acting entirely FREE from any influence, internal as well as external."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1666","context":"That is the problem which lies at the root of difficulty--and the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1667","context":"difficulty that lies at the root of the problem."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1669","context":"Strictly speaking, there cannot be said to be any \"Reason\" whatsoever"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1670","context":"for THE ALL to act, for a \"reason\" implies a \"cause,\" and THE ALL is"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1671","context":"above Cause and Effect, except when it Wills to become a Cause, at which"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1672","context":"time the Principle is set into motion. So, you see, the matter is"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1673","context":"Unthinkable, just as THE ALL is Unknowable. Just as we say THE ALL"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1674","context":"merely \"IS\"--so we are compelled to say that \"THE ALL ACTS BECAUSE IT"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1675","context":"ACTS.\" At the last, THE ALL is All Reason in Itself; All Law in Itself;"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1676","context":"All Action in Itself--and it may be said, truthfully, that THE ALL is"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1677","context":"Its Own Reason; its own Law; its own Act--or still further, that THE"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1678","context":"ALL; Its Reason; Its Act; is Law; are ONE, all being names for the same"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1679","context":"thing. In the opinion of those who are giving you these present lessons,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1680","context":"the answer is locked up in the INNER SELF of THE ALL, along with its"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1681","context":"Secret of Being. The Law of Correspondence, in our opinion, reaches only"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1682","context":"to that aspect of THE ALL, which may be spoken of as \"The Aspect of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1683","context":"BECOMING.\" Back of that Aspect is \"The Aspect of BEING\" in which all"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1684","context":"Laws are lost in LAW; all Principles merge into PRINCIPLE--and THE ALL;"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1685","context":"PRINCIPLE; and BEING; are IDENTICAL, ONE AND THE SAME. Therefore,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1686","context":"Metaphysical speculation on this point is futile. We go into the matter"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1687","context":"here, merely to show that we recognize the question, and also the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1688","context":"absurdity of the ordinary answers of metaphysics and theology."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1690","context":"In conclusion, it may be of interest to our students to learn that while"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_1692","context":"in the direction of applying the Principle of Correspondence to the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1693","context":"question, with the result of the \"Inner Nature\" conclusion,--still the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1694","context":"legends have it that HERMES, the Great, when asked this question by his"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1695","context":"advanced students, answered them by PRESSING HIS LIPS TIGHTLY TOGETHER"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1696","context":"and saying not a word, indicating that there WAS NO ANSWER. But, then,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1697","context":"he may have intended to apply the axiom of his philosophy, that: \"The"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_1699","context":"believing that even his advanced students did not possess the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1700","context":"Understanding which entitled them to the Teaching. At any rate, if"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1701","context":"Hermes possessed the Secret, he failed to impart it, and so far as the"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_1703","context":"the Great Hermes hesitated to speak, what mortal may dare to teach?"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1705","context":"But, remember, that whatever be the answer to this problem, if indeed"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1706","context":"there be an answer the truth remains that:  \"While All is in THE ALL, it"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_1737","context":"great scale of Life, the lowest point of which is undifferentiated"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1738","context":"Matter, and the highest point that of Spirit. And, moreover, the"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_1747","context":"of, the subject of these different planes, still we think it well to"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1748","context":"give a general description of the same at this point."}

{"symbol":"five_rings_1752","context":"word \"Plane\", which term has been very freely used, and very poorly"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_1759","context":"measurement.\" Somewhat paradoxical, is it not? But let us examine the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1760","context":"matter. A \"dimension,\" you know, is \"a measure in a straight line,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1761","context":"relating to measure,\" etc. The ordinary dimensions of space are length,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_1762","context":"breadth, and height, or perhaps length, breadth, height, thickness or"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_2163","context":"serving as a medium of transmission of waves of vibratory energy, such"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2164","context":"as heat, light, electricity, magnetism, etc. The Teachings are that The"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2165","context":"Ethereal Substance is a connecting link between the forms of vibratory"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2166","context":"energy known as \"Matter\" on the one hand, and \"Energy or Force\" on the"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_2170","context":"Scientists have offered the illustration of a rapidly moving wheel, top,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2171","context":"or cylinder, to show the effects of increasing rates of vibration. The"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2172","context":"illustration supposes a wheel, top, or revolving cylinder, running at a"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2173","context":"low rate of speed--we will call this revolving thing \"the object\" in"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2174","context":"following out the illustration. Let us suppose the object moving slowly."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2175","context":"It may be seen readily, but no sound of its movement reaches the ear."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2176","context":"The speed is gradually increased. In a few moments its movement becomes"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2177","context":"so rapid that a deep growl or low note may be heard. Then as the rate is"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2178","context":"increased the note rises one in the musical scale. Then, the motion"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2179","context":"being still further increased, the next highest note is distinguished."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2180","context":"Then, one after another, all the notes of the musical scale appear,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2181","context":"rising higher and higher as the motion is increased. Finally when the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2182","context":"motions have reached a certain rate the final note perceptible to human"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2183","context":"ears is reached and the shrill, piercing shriek dies away, and silence"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2184","context":"follows. No sound is heard from the revolving object, the rate of motion"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2185","context":"being so high that the human ear cannot register the vibrations. Then"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2186","context":"comes the perception of rising degrees of Heat. Then after quite a time"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2187","context":"the eye catches a glimpse of the object becoming a dull dark reddish"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2188","context":"color. As the rate increases, the red becomes brighter. Then as the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2189","context":"speed is increased, the red melts into an orange. Then the orange melts"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2190","context":"into a yellow. Then follow, successively, the shades of green, blue,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2191","context":"indigo, and finally violet, as the rate of sped increases. Then the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2192","context":"violet shades away, and all color disappears, the human eye not"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2193","context":"being able to register them. But there are invisible rays emanating from"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2194","context":"the revolving object, the rays that are used in photographing, and other"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2195","context":"subtle rays of light. Then begin to manifest the peculiar rays known as"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2196","context":"the \"X Rays,\" etc., as the constitution of the object changes."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2197","context":"Electricity and Magnetism are emitted when the appropriate rate of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2198","context":"vibration is attained."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2200","context":"When the object reaches a certain rate of vibration its molecules"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2201","context":"disintegrate, and resolve themselves into the original elements or"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2202","context":"atoms. Then the atoms, following the Principle of Vibration, are"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2203","context":"separated into the countless corpuscles of which they are composed. And"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2204","context":"finally, even the corpuscles disappear and the object may be said to Be"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2205","context":"composed of The Ethereal Substance. Science does not dare to follow the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2206","context":"illustration further, but the Hermetists teach that if the vibrations be"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2207","context":"continually increased the object would mount up the successive states of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2208","context":"manifestation and would in turn manifest the various mental stages, and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2209","context":"then on Spiritward, until it would finally re-enter THE ALL, which is"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2210","context":"Absolute Spirit. The \"object,\" however, would have ceased to be an"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2211","context":"\"object\" long before the stage of Ethereal Substance was reached, but"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2212","context":"otherwise the illustration is correct inasmuch as it shows the effect of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2213","context":"constantly increased rates and modes of vibration. It must be"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2214","context":"remembered, in the above illustration, that at the stages at which the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2215","context":"\"object\" throws off vibrations of light, heat, etc., it is not actually"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2216","context":"\"resolved\" into those forms of energy (which are much higher in the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2217","context":"scale), but simply that it reaches a degree of vibration in which those"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2218","context":"forms of energy are liberated, in a degree, from the confining"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2219","context":"influences of its molecules, atoms and corpuscles, as the case may be."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2220","context":"These forms of energy, although much higher in the scale than matter,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2221","context":"are imprisoned and confined in the material combinations, by reason of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2222","context":"the energies manifesting through, and using material forms, but thus"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2223","context":"becoming entangled and confined in their creations of material forms,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2224","context":"which, to an extent, is true of all creations, the creating force"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2225","context":"becoming involved in its creation."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2227","context":"But the Hermetic Teachings go much further than do those of modern"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2228","context":"science. They teach that all manifestation of thought, emotion, reason,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2229","context":"will or desire, or any mental state or condition, are accompanied by"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2230","context":"vibrations, a portion of which are thrown off and which tend to affect"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2231","context":"the minds of other persons by \"induction.\" This is the principle which"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2232","context":"produces the phenomena of \"telepathy\"; mental influence, and other forms"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2233","context":"of the action and power of mind over mind, with which the general public"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2234","context":"is rapidly becoming acquainted, owing to the wide dissemination of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2235","context":"occult knowledge by the various schools, cults and teachers along these"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2236","context":"lines at this time."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2238","context":"Every thought, emotion or mental state has its corresponding rate and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2239","context":"mode of vibration. And by an effort of the will of the person, or of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2240","context":"other persons, these mental states may be reproduced, just as a musical"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2241","context":"tone may be reproduced by causing an instrument to vibrate at a certain"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2242","context":"rate--just as color may be reproduced in the same may. By a knowledge of"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_2244","context":"polarize his mind at any degree he wishes, thus gaining a perfect"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2245","context":"control over his mental states, moods, etc. In the same way he may"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2246","context":"affect the minds of others, producing the desired mental states in them."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2247","context":"In short, he may be able to produce on the Mental Plane that which"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_2276","context":"The great Fourth Hermetic Principle--the Principle of Polarity embodies"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2277","context":"the truth that all manifested things have \"two sides\"; \"two aspects\";"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2278","context":"\"two poles\"; a \"pair of opposites,\" with manifold degrees between the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2279","context":"two extremes. The old paradoxes, which have ever perplexed the mind of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2280","context":"men, are explained by an understanding of this Principle. Man has always"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2281","context":"recognized something akin to this Principle, and has endeavored to"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2282","context":"express it by such sayings, maxims and aphorisms as the following:"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2283","context":"\"Everything is and isn't, at the same time\"; \"all truths are but"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2284","context":"half-truths\"; \"every truth is half-false\"; \"there are two sides to"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2285","context":"everything\"--\"there is a reverse side to every shield,\" etc., etc."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2287","context":"The Hermetic Teachings are to the effect that the difference between"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2288","context":"things seemingly diametrically opposed to each other is merely a matter"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2289","context":"of degree. It teaches that \"the pairs of opposites may be reconciled,\""}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2290","context":"and that \"thesis and anti-thesis are identical in nature, but different"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2291","context":"in degree\"; and that the \"universal reconciliation of opposites\" is"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2292","context":"effected by a recognition of this Principle of Polarity. The teachers"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2293","context":"claim that illustrations of this Principle may be had on every hand, and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2294","context":"from an examination into the real nature of anything. They begin by"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2295","context":"showing that Spirit and Matter are but the two poles of the same thing,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2296","context":"the intermediate planes being merely degrees of vibration. They show"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2297","context":"that THE ALL and The Many are the same, the difference being merely a"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2298","context":"matter of degree of Mental Manifestation. Thus the LAW and Laws are the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2299","context":"two opposite poles of one thing. Likewise, PRINCIPLE and Principles."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2300","context":"Infinite Mind and finite minds."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2302","context":"Then passing on to the Physical Plane, they illustrate the Principle by"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2303","context":"showing that Heat and Cold are identical in nature, the differences"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2304","context":"being merely a matter of degrees. The thermometer shows many degrees of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2305","context":"temperature, the lowest pole being called \"cold,\" and the highest"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2306","context":"\"heat.\" Between these two poles are many degrees of \"heat\" or \"cold,\""}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2307","context":"call them either and you are equally correct. The higher of two degrees"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2308","context":"is always \"warmer,\" while the lower is always \"colder.\" There is no"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2309","context":"absolute standard-all is a matter of degree. There is no place on the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2310","context":"thermometer where heat ceases and cold begins. It is all a matter of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2311","context":"higher or lower vibrations. The very terms \"high\" and \"low,\" which we"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2312","context":"are compelled to use, are but poles of the same thing-the terms are"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2313","context":"relative. So with \"East and West\"--travel around the world in an"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2314","context":"eastward direction, and you reach a point which is called west at your"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2315","context":"starting point, and you return from that westward point. Travel far"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2316","context":"enough North, and you will find yourself traveling South, or vice versa."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2318","context":"Light and Darkness are poles of the same thing, with many degrees"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2319","context":"between them. The musical scale is the same--starting with \"C\" you move"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2320","context":"upward until you reach another \"C\" and so on, the differences between"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2321","context":"the two ends of the board being the same, with many degrees between the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2322","context":"two extremes. The scale of color is the same-higher and lower vibrations"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2323","context":"being the only difference between high violet and low red. Large and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2324","context":"Small are relative. So are Noise and Quiet; Hard and Soft follow the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2325","context":"rule. Likewise Sharp and Dull. Positive and Negative are two poles of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2326","context":"the same thing, with countless degrees between them."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2328","context":"Good and Bad are not absolute--we call one end of the scale Good and the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2329","context":"other Bad, or one end Good and the other Evil, according to the use of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2330","context":"the terms. A thing is \"less good\" than the thing higher in the scale;"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2331","context":"but that \"less good\" thing, in turn, is \"more good\" than the thing next"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2332","context":"below it--and so on, the \"more or less\" being regulated by the position"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2333","context":"on the scale."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2335","context":"And so it is on the Mental Plane. \"Love and. Hate\" are generally"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2336","context":"regarded as being things diametrically opposed to each other; entirely"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2337","context":"different; unreconcilable. But we apply the Principle of Polarity; we"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2338","context":"find that there is no such thing as Absolute Love or Absolute Hate, as"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2339","context":"distinguished from each other. The two are merely terms applied to the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2340","context":"two poles of the same thing. Beginning at any point of the scale we find"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2341","context":"\"more love,\" or \"less hate,\" as we ascend the scale; and \"more hate\" or"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2342","context":"\"less love\" as we descend this being true no matter from what point,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2343","context":"high or low, we may start. There are degrees of Love and Hate, and there"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2344","context":"is a middle point where \"Like and Dislike\" become so faint that it is"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2345","context":"difficult to distinguish between them. Courage and Fear come under the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2346","context":"same rule. The Pairs of Opposites exist everywhere. Where you find one"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2347","context":"thing you find its opposite-the two poles."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2349","context":"And it is this fact that enables the Hermetist to transmute one mental"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2350","context":"state into another, along the lines of Polarization. Things belonging to"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2351","context":"different classes cannot be transmuted into each other, but things of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2352","context":"the same class may be changed, that is, may have their polarity changed."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2353","context":"Thus Love never becomes East or West, or Red or Violet-but it may and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2354","context":"often does turn into Hate and likewise Hate may be transformed into"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2355","context":"Love, by changing its polarity. Courage may be transmuted into Fear, and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2356","context":"the reverse. Hard things may be rendered Soft. Dull things become Sharp."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2357","context":"Hot things become Cold. And so on, the transmutation always being"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2358","context":"between things of the same kind of different degrees. Take the case of a"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2359","context":"Fearful man. By raising his mental vibrations along the line of Fear-"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2360","context":"Courage, he can be filled with the highest degree of Courage and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2361","context":"Fearlessness. And, likewise, the Slothful man may change himself into an"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2362","context":"Active, Energetic individual simply by polarizing along the lines of the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2363","context":"desired quality."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2365","context":"The student who is familiar with the processes by which the various"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2366","context":"schools of Mental Science, etc., produce changes in the mental states of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2367","context":"those following their teachings, may not readily understand the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2368","context":"principle underlying many of these changes. When, however, the Principle"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2369","context":"of Polarity is once grasped, and it is seen that the mental changes are"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2370","context":"occasioned by a change of polarity-a sliding along the same scale-the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2371","context":"hatter is readily understood. The change is not in the nature of a"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2372","context":"transmutation of one thing into another thing entirely different-but is"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2373","context":"merely a change of degree in the same things, a vastly important"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2374","context":"difference. For instance, borrowing an analogy from the Physical Plane,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2375","context":"it is impossible to change Heat into Sharpness, Loudness, Highness,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2376","context":"etc., but Heat may readily be transmuted into Cold, simply by lowering"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2377","context":"the vibrations. In the same way Hate and Love are mutually transmutable;"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2378","context":"so are Fear and Courage. But Fear cannot be transformed into Love, nor"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2379","context":"can Courage be transmuted into Hate. The mental states belong to"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2380","context":"innumerable classes, each class of which has its opposite poles, along"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2381","context":"which transmutation is possible."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2383","context":"The student will readily recognize that in the mental states, as well as"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2384","context":"in the phenomena of the Physical Plane, the two poles may be classified"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2385","context":"as Positive and Negative, respectively. Thus Love is Positive to Hate;"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2386","context":"Courage to Fear; Activity to Non-Activity, etc., etc. And it will also"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2387","context":"be noticed that even to those unfamiliar with the Principle of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2388","context":"Vibration, the Positive pole seems to be of a higher degree than the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2389","context":"Negative, and readily dominates it. The tendency of Nature is in the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2390","context":"direction of the dominant activity of the Positive pole."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2392","context":"In addition to the changing of the poles of one's own mental states by"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2393","context":"the operation of the art of Polarization, the phenomena of Mental"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2394","context":"Influence, in its manifold phases, shows us that the principle may be"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2395","context":"extended so as to embrace the phenomena of the influence of one mind"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2396","context":"over that of another, of which so much has been written and taught of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2397","context":"late years. When it is understood that Mental Induction is possible,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2398","context":"that is that mental states may be produced by \"induction\" from others,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2399","context":"then we can readily see how a certain rate of vibration, or polarization"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2400","context":"of a certain mental state, may be communicated to another person, and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2401","context":"his polarity in that class of mental states thus changed. It is along"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2402","context":"this principle that the results of many of the \"mental treatments\" are"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2403","context":"obtained. For instance, a person is \"blue,\" melancholy and full of fear."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2404","context":"A mental scientist bringing his own mind up to the desired vibration by"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2405","context":"his trained will, and thus obtaining the desired polarization in his own"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2406","context":"case, then produces a similar mental state in the other by induction,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2407","context":"the result being that the vibrations are raised and the person polarizes"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2408","context":"toward the Positive end of the scale instead toward the Negative, and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2409","context":"his Fear and other negative emotions are transmuted to Courage and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2410","context":"similar positive mental states. A little study will show you that these"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2411","context":"mental changes are nearly all along the line of Polarization, the change"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2412","context":"being one of degree rather than of kind."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2414","context":"A knowledge of the existence of this great Hermetic Principle will"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2415","context":"enable the student to better understand his own mental states, and those"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2416","context":"of other people. He will see that these states are all matters of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2417","context":"degree, and seeing thus, he will be able to raise or lower the vibration"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2418","context":"at will--to change his mental poles, and thus be Master of his mental"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2419","context":"states, instead of being their servant and slave. And by his knowledge"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_2491","context":"that it accounts for the bewildering succession of moods, feelings and"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_2493","context":"the Hermetists by studying the operations of this Principle have learned"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2494","context":"to escape some of its activities by Transmutation."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2496","context":"The Hermetic Masters long since discovered that while the Principle of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2497","context":"Rhythm was invariable, and ever in evidence in mental phenomena, still"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2498","context":"there were two planes of its manifestation so far as mental phenomena"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2499","context":"are concerned. They discovered that there were two general planes of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2500","context":"Consciousness, the Lower and the Higher, the understanding of which fact"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2501","context":"enabled them to rise to the higher plane and thus escape the swing of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2502","context":"the Rhythmic pendulum which manifested on the lower plane. In other"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2503","context":"words, the swing of the pendulum occurred on the Unconscious Plane, and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2504","context":"the Consciousness was not affected. This they call the Law of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2505","context":"Neutralization. Its operations consist in the raising of the Ego above"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2506","context":"the vibrations of the Unconscious Plane of mental activity, so that the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2507","context":"negative-swing of the pendulum is not manifested in consciousness, and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2508","context":"therefore they are not affected. It is akin to rising above a thing and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2509","context":"letting it pass beneath you. The Hermetic Master, or advanced student,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2510","context":"polarizes himself at the desired pole, and by a process akin to"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2511","context":"\"refusing\" to participate in the backward swing or, if you prefer, a"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2512","context":"\"denial\" of its influence over him, he stands firm in his polarized"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2513","context":"position, and allows the mental pendulum to swing back along the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2514","context":"unconscious plane. All individuals who have attained any degree of self-"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2515","context":"mastery, accomplish this, more or less unknowingly, and by refusing to"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2516","context":"allow their moods and negative mental states to affect them, they apply"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2517","context":"the Law of Neutralization. The Master, however, carries this to a much"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2518","context":"higher degree of proficiency, and by the use of his Will he attains"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2519","context":"a degree of Poise and Mental Firmness almost impossible of belief on the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2520","context":"part of those who allow themselves to be swung backward and forward by"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2521","context":"the mental pendulum of moods and feelings."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2523","context":"The importance of this will be appreciated by any thinking person who"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2524","context":"realizes what creatures of moods, feelings and emotion the majority of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2525","context":"people are, and how little mastery of themselves they manifest. If you"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2526","context":"will stop and consider a moment, you will realize how much these swings"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2527","context":"of Rhythm have affected you in your life--how a period of Enthusiasm has"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2528","context":"been invariably followed by an opposite feeling and mood of Depression."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2529","context":"Likewise, your moods and periods of Courage have been succeeded by equal"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2530","context":"moods of Fear. And so it has ever been with the majority of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2531","context":"persons--tides of feeling have ever risen and fallen with them, but they"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2532","context":"have never suspected the cause or reason of the mental phenomena. An"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2533","context":"understanding of the workings of this Principle will give one the key to"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2534","context":"the Mastery of these rhythmic swings of feeling, and will enable him to"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2535","context":"know himself better and to avoid being carried away by these inflows and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2536","context":"outflows. The Will is superior to the conscious manifestation of this"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2537","context":"Principle, although the Principle itself can never be destroyed. We may"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2538","context":"escape its effects, but the Principle operates, nevertheless. The"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2539","context":"pendulum ever swings, although we may escape being carried along with"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2542","context":"There are other features of the operation of this Principle of Rhythm of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2543","context":"which we wish to speak at this point. There comes into its operations"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2544","context":"that which is known as the Law of Compensation. One of the definitions"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2545","context":"or meanings of the word \"Compensate\" is, \"to counterbalance\" which is"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2546","context":"the sense in which the Hermetists use the term. It is this Law of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2547","context":"Compensation to which the Kybalion refers when it says: \"The measure of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2548","context":"the swing to the right is the measure of the swing to the left; rhythm"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2549","context":"compensates.\""}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2551","context":"The Law of Compensation is that the swing in one direction determines"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2552","context":"the swing in the opposite direction, or to the opposite pole-the one"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2553","context":"balances, or counterbalances, the other. On the Physical Plane we see"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2554","context":"many examples of this Law. The pendulum of the clock swings a certain"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2555","context":"distance to the right, and then an equal distance to the left. The"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2556","context":"seasons balance each other in the same way. The tides follow the same"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2557","context":"Law. And the same Law is manifested in all the phenomena of Rhythm. The"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2558","context":"pendulum, with a short swing in one direction, has but a short swing in"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2559","context":"the other; while the long swing to the right invariably means the long"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2560","context":"swing to the left.  An object hurled upward to a certain height has an"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2561","context":"equal distance to traverse on its return. The force with which a"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2562","context":"projectile is sent upward a mile is reproduced when the projectile"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2563","context":"returns to the earth on its return journey. This Law is constant on the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2564","context":"Physical Plane, as reference to the standard authorities will show you."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2566","context":"But the Hermetists carry it still further. They teach that a man's"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2567","context":"mental states are subject to the same Law. The man who enjoys keenly, is"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2568","context":"subject to keen suffering; while he who feels but little pain is capable"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2569","context":"of feeling but little joy. The pig suffers but little mentally, and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2570","context":"enjoys but little--he is compensated. And on the other hand, there are"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2571","context":"other animals who enjoy keenly, but whose nervous organism and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2572","context":"temperament cause them to suffer exquisite degrees of pain and so it is"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2573","context":"with Man. There are temperaments which permit of but low degrees of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2574","context":"enjoyment, and equally low degrees of suffering; while there are others"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2575","context":"which permit the most intense enjoyment, but also the most intense"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2576","context":"suffering. The rule is that the capacity for pain and pleasure, in each"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2577","context":"individual, are balanced. The Law of Compensation is in full operation"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2580","context":"But the Hermetists go still further in this matter. They teach that"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2581","context":"before one is able to enjoy a certain degree of pleasure, he must have"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2582","context":"swung as far, proportionately, toward the other pole of feeling. They"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2583","context":"hold, however, that the Negative is precedent to the Positive in this"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2584","context":"matter, that is to say that in experiencing a certain degree of pleasure"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2585","context":"it does not follow that he will have to \"pay up for it\" with a"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2586","context":"corresponding degree of pain; on the contrary, the pleasure is the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2587","context":"Rhythmic swing, according to the Law of Compensation, for a degree of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2588","context":"pain previously experienced either in the present life, or in a previous"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2589","context":"incarnation. This throws a new light on the Problem of Pain."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2591","context":"The Hermetists regard the chain of lives as continuous, and as forming a"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2592","context":"part of one life of the individual, so that in consequence the rhythmic"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2593","context":"swing is understood in this way, while it would be without meaning"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2594","context":"unless the truth of reincarnation is admitted."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2596","context":"But the Hermetists claim that the Master or advanced student is able, to"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2597","context":"a great degree, to escape the swing toward Pain, by the process of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2598","context":"Neutralization before mentioned. By rising on to the higher plane of the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2599","context":"Ego, much of the experience that comes to those dwelling on the lower"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2600","context":"plane is avoided and escaped."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2602","context":"The Law of Compensation plays an important part in the lives of men and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2603","context":"women. It will be noticed that one generally \"pays the price\" of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2604","context":"anything he possesses or lacks. If he has one thing, he lacks"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2605","context":"another--the balance is struck. No one can \"keep his penny and have the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2606","context":"bit of cake\" at the same time Everything has its pleasant and unpleasant"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2607","context":"sides. The things that one gains are always paid for by the things that"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2608","context":"one loses. The rich possess much that the poor lack, while the poor"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2609","context":"often possess things that are beyond the reach of the rich. The"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2610","context":"millionaire may have the inclination toward feasting, and the wealth"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2611","context":"wherewith to secure all the dainties and luxuries of the table, while he"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2612","context":"lacks the appetite to enjoy the same; he envies the appetite and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2613","context":"digestion of the laborer who lacks the wealth and inclinations of the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2614","context":"millionaire, and who gets more pleasure from his plain food than the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2615","context":"millionaire could obtain even if his appetite were not jaded, nor his"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2616","context":"digestion ruined, for the wants, habits and inclinations differ. And so"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2617","context":"it is through life. The Law of Compensation is ever in operation,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2618","context":"striving to balance and counter-balance, and always succeeding in time,"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_2643","context":"the details of the operations of the Principle, and still more often"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2644","context":"upon the meaning of certain words. The underlying Principle of Cause and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2645","context":"Effect has been accepted as correct by practically all the thinkers of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2646","context":"the world worthy of the name. To think otherwise would be to take the"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_2648","context":"relegate it; to the control of the imaginary something which men have"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_2651","context":"A little consideration will show anyone that there is in reality no such"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_2654","context":"the operation or activity of such agent; the supposed effect of such an"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2655","context":"agent; a happening; fortuity; casualty, etc.\" But a little consideration"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2656","context":"will show you that there can be no such agent as \"Chance,\" in the sense"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2657","context":"of something outside of Law-something outside of Cause and Effect. How"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2658","context":"could there be a something acting in the phenomenal universe,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2659","context":"independent of the laws, order, and continuity of the latter? Such a"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2660","context":"something would be entirely independent of the orderly trend of the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2661","context":"universe, and therefore superior to it. We can imagine nothing outside"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2662","context":"of THE ALL being outside of the Law, and that only because THE ALL is"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2663","context":"the LAW in itself. There is no room in the universe for a something"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2664","context":"outside of and independent of Law. The existence of such a Something"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2665","context":"would render all Natural Laws ineffective, and would plunge the universe"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2666","context":"into chaotic disorder and lawlessness."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2668","context":"A careful examination will show that what we call \"Chance\" is merely an"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2669","context":"expression relating to obscure causes; causes that we cannot perceive;"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2670","context":"causes that we cannot understand. The word Chance is derived from a word"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2671","context":"Meaning \"to fall\" (as the falling of dice), the idea being that the fall"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2672","context":"of the dice (and many other happenings) are merely a \"happening\""}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2673","context":"unrelated to any cause. And this is the sense in which the term is"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2674","context":"generally employed. But when the matter is closely examined, it is seen"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2675","context":"that there is no chance whatsoever about the fall of the dice. Each time"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2676","context":"a die falls, and displays a certain number, it obeys a law as infallible"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2677","context":"as that which governs the revolution of the planets around the sun. Back"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2678","context":"of the fall of the die are causes, or chains of causes, running back"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_2680","context":"the amount of muscular energy expended in the throw; the condition of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2681","context":"the table, etc., etc., all are causes, the effect of which may be seen."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2682","context":"But back of these seen causes there are chains of unseen preceding"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2683","context":"causes, all of which had a bearing upon the number of the die which fell"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_2686","context":"If a die be cast a great number of times, it will be found that the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2687","context":"numbers shown will be about equal, that is, there will be an equal"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2688","context":"number of one-spot, two-spot, etc., coming uppermost. Toss a penny in"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2689","context":"the air, and it may come down either \"heads\" or \"tails\"; but make a"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2690","context":"sufficient number of tosses, and the heads and tails will about even up."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2691","context":"This is the operation of the law of average. But both the average and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2692","context":"the single toss come under the Law of Cause and Effect, and if we were"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2693","context":"able to examine into the preceding causes, it would be clearly seen that"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2694","context":"it was simply impossible for the die to fall other than it did, under"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2695","context":"the same circumstances and at the same time. Given the same causes, the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2696","context":"same results will follow. There is always a \"cause\" and a \"because\" to"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2697","context":"every event. Nothing ever \"happens\" without a cause, or rather a chain"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_2838","context":"than the term \"Sex,\" the latter referring to the physical distinctions"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_2842","context":"the reason that certain writers, who have acquired a smattering of the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2843","context":"Hermetic Philosophy, have sought to identify this Seventh Hermetic"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2844","context":"Principle with wild and fanciful, and often reprehensible, theories and"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_2847","context":"The office of Gender is solely that of creating, producing, generating,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2848","context":"etc., and its manifestations are visible on every plane of phenomena. It"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2849","context":"is somewhat difficult to produce proofs of this along scientific lines,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2850","context":"for the reason that science has not as yet recognized this Principle as"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2851","context":"of universal application. But still some proofs are forthcoming from"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2852","context":"scientific sources. In the first place, we find a distinct manifestation"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2853","context":"of the Principle of Gender among the corpuscles, ions, or electrons,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2854","context":"which constitute the basis of Matter as science now knows the latter,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2855","context":"and which by forming certain combinations form the Atom, which until"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2856","context":"lately was regarded as final and indivisible."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2858","context":"The latest word of science is that the atom is composed of a multitude"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2859","context":"of corpuscles, electrons, or ions (the various names being applied by"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2860","context":"different authorities) revolving around each other and vibrating at a"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2861","context":"high degree and intensity. But the accompanying statement is made that"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2862","context":"the formation of the atom is really due to the clustering of negative"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2863","context":"corpuscles around a positive one---the positive corpuscles seeming to"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2864","context":"exert a certain influence upon the negative corpuscles, causing the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2865","context":"latter to assume certain combinations and thus \"create\" or \"generate\" an"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2866","context":"atom. This is in line with the most ancient Hermetic Teachings, which"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2867","context":"have always identified the Masculine principle of Gender with the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2868","context":"\"Positive,\" and the Feminine with the \"Negative\" Poles of Electricity"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2869","context":"(so called)."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2871","context":"Now a word at this point regarding this identification. The public mind"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2872","context":"has formed an entirely erroneous impression regarding the qualities of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2873","context":"the so-called \"Negative\" pole of electrified or magnetized Matter. The"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2874","context":"terms Positive and Negative are very wrongly applied to this phenomenon"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2875","context":"by science. The word Positive means something real and strong, as"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2876","context":"compared with a Negative unreality or weakness. Nothing is further from"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2877","context":"the real facts of electrical phenomenon. The so-called Negative pole of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2878","context":"the battery is really the pole in and by which the generation or"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2879","context":"production of new forms and energies is manifested. There is nothing"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2880","context":"\"negative\" about it. The best scientific authorities now use the word"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2881","context":"\"Cathode\" in place of \"Negative,\" the word Cathode coming from the Greek"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2882","context":"root meaning \"descent; the path of generation, etc,\" From the Cathode"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2883","context":"pole emerge the swarm of electrons or corpuscles; from the same pole"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2884","context":"emerge those wonderful \"rays\" which have revolutionized scientific"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2885","context":"conceptions during the past decade. The Cathode pole is the Mother of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2886","context":"all of the strange phenomena which have rendered useless the old"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2887","context":"textbooks, and which have caused many long accepted theories to be"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2888","context":"relegated to the scrap-pile of scientific speculation. The Cathode, or"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2889","context":"Negative Pole, is the Mother Principle of Electrical Phenomena, and of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2890","context":"the finest forms of matter as yet known to science. So you see we are"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2891","context":"justified in refusing to use the term \"Negative\" in our consideration of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2892","context":"the subject, and in insisting upon substituting the word \"Feminine\" for"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2893","context":"the old term. The facts of the case bear us out in this, without taking"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2894","context":"the Hermetic Teachings into consideration. And so we shall use the word"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2895","context":"\"Feminine\" in the place of \"Negative\" in speaking of that pole of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2898","context":"The latest scientific teachings are that the creative corpuscles or"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2899","context":"electrons are Feminine (science says \"they are composed of negative"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2900","context":"electricity\"-we say they are composed of Feminine energy). A Feminine"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2901","context":"corpuscle becomes detached from, or rather leaves, a Masculine"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2902","context":"corpuscle, and starts on a new career. It actively seeks a union with a"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2903","context":"Masculine corpuscle, being urged thereto by the natural impulse to"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2904","context":"create new forms of Matter or Energy. One writer goes so far as to use"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2905","context":"the term \"it at once seeks, of its own volition, a union,\" etc. This"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2906","context":"detachment and uniting form the basis of the greater part of the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2907","context":"activities of the chemical world. When the Feminine corpuscle unites"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2908","context":"with a Masculine corpuscle, a certain process is begun. The Feminine"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2909","context":"particles vibrate rapidly under the influence of the Masculine energy,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2910","context":"and circle rapidly around the latter. The result is the birth of a new"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2911","context":"atom. This new atom is really composed of a union of the Masculine and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2912","context":"Feminine electrons, or corpuscles, but when the union is formed the atom"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2913","context":"is a separate thing, having certain properties, but no longer"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2914","context":"manifesting the property of free electricity. The process of detachment"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2915","context":"or separation of the Feminine electrons is called \"ionization.\" These"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2916","context":"electrons, or corpuscles, are the most active workers in Nature's field."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2917","context":"Arising from their unions, or combinations, manifest the varied"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2918","context":"phenomena of light, heat, electricity, magnetism, attraction,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2919","context":"repulsion, chemical affinity and the reverse, and similar phenomena. And"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2920","context":"all this arises from the operation of the Principle of Gender on the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2921","context":"plane of Energy."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2923","context":"The part of the Masculine principle seems to be that of directing a"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2924","context":"certain inherent energy toward the Feminine principle, and thus starting"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2925","context":"into activity the creative processes. But the Feminine principle is the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2926","context":"one always doing the active creative work-and this is so on all planes."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2927","context":"And yet, each principle is incapable of operative energy without the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2928","context":"assistance of the other. In some of the forms of life, the two"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2929","context":"principles are combined in one organism. For that matter, everything in"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2930","context":"the organic world manifests both genders--there is always the Masculine"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2931","context":"present in the Feminine form, and the Feminine form.  The Hermetic"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2932","context":"Teachings include much regarding the operation of the two principles of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2933","context":"Gender in the production and manifestation of various forms of energy,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2934","context":"etc., but we do not deem it expedient to go into detail regarding the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2935","context":"same at this point, because we are unable to back up the same with"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2936","context":"scientific proof, for the reason that science has not as yet progressed"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2937","context":"thus far. But the example we have given you of the phenomena of the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2938","context":"electrons or corpuscles will show you that science is on the right path,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2939","context":"and will also give you a general idea of the underlying principles."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2941","context":"Some leading scientific investigators have announced their belief that"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2942","context":"in the formation of crystals there was to be found something that"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2943","context":"corresponded to \"sex-activity\" which is another straw showing the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2944","context":"direction the scientific winds are blowing. And each year will bring"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2945","context":"other facts to corroborate the correctness of the Hermetic Principle of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2946","context":"Gender. It will be found that Gender is in constant operation and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2947","context":"manifestation in the field of inorganic matter, and in the field of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2948","context":"Energy or Force. Electricity is now generally regarded as the"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_2951","context":"scientific doctrine, and is growing rapidly in popularity and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2952","context":"general acceptance. And it thus follows that if we are able to discover"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2953","context":"in the phenomena of electricity-even at the very root and source of its"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2954","context":"manifestations a clear and unmistakable evidence of the presence of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2955","context":"Gender and its activities, we are justified in asking you to believe"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2956","context":"that science at last has offered proofs of the existence in all"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2957","context":"universal phenomena of that great Hermetic Principle-the Principle of"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_2961","context":"of the \"attraction and repulsion\" of the atoms; chemical affinity; the"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_2963","context":"between the molecules of matter. These facts are too well known to need"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2964","context":"extended comment from us. But, have you ever considered that all of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2965","context":"these things are manifestations of the Gender Principle? Can you not see"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_2966","context":"that the phenomena is \"on all fours\" with that of the corpuscles or"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_3020","context":"admit many of the facts claimed for the two respective aspects--some of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3021","context":"the said theories and claims being very far-fetched and incapable of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3022","context":"standing the test of experiment and demonstration.  We point to the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3023","context":"phases of agreement merely for the purpose of helping the student to"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3024","context":"assimilate his previously acquired knowledge with the teachings of the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3025","context":"Hermetic Philosophy. Students of Hudson will notice the statement at the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3026","context":"beginning of his second chapter of \"The Law of Psychic Phenomena,\" that:"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3027","context":"\"The mystic jargon of the Hermetic philosophers discloses the same"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3028","context":"general idea\" i.e., the duality of mind. If Dr. Hudson had taken"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3029","context":"the time and trouble to decipher a little of \"the mystic jargon of the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3030","context":"Hermetic Philosophy,\" he might have received much light upon the subject"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3031","context":"of \"the dual mind\"--but then, perhaps, his most interesting work might"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3032","context":"not have been written. Let us now consider the Hermetic Teachings"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3033","context":"regarding Mental Gender."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3035","context":"The Hermetic Teachers impart their instruction regarding this subject by"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3036","context":"bidding their students examine the report of their consciousness"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3037","context":"regarding their Self. The students are bidden to turn their attention"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3038","context":"inward upon the Self dwelling within each. Each student is led to see"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3039","context":"that his consciousness gives him first a report of the existence of his"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3040","context":"Self-the report is \"I Am.\" This at first seems to be the final words"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3041","context":"from the consciousness, but a little further examination discloses the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3042","context":"fact that this \"I Am\" may be separated or split into two distinct parts,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3043","context":"or aspects, which while working in unison and in conjunction, yet,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3044","context":"nevertheless, may be separated in consciousness."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3046","context":"While at first there seems to be only an \"I\" existing, a more careful"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3047","context":"and closer examination reveals the fact that there exists an \"I\" and a"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3048","context":"\"Me.\" These mental twins differ in their characteristics and nature, and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3049","context":"an examination of their nature and the phenomena arising from the same"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3050","context":"will throw much light upon many of the problems of mental influence."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3052","context":"Let us begin with a consideration of the Me, which is usually mistaken"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3053","context":"for the I by the student, until he presses the inquiry a little further"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3054","context":"back into the recesses of consciousness. A man thinks of his Self (in"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3055","context":"its aspect of Me) as being composed of certain feelings, tastes likes,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3056","context":"dislikes, habits, peculiar ties, characteristics, etc., all of which go"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3057","context":"to make up his personality, or the \"Self\" known to himself and others."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3058","context":"He knows that these emotions and feelings change; are born and die away;"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3059","context":"are subject to the Principle of Rhythm, and the Principle of Polarity,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3060","context":"which take him from one extreme of feeling to another. He also thinks of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3061","context":"the \"Me\" as being certain knowledge gathered together in his mind, and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3062","context":"thus forming a part of himself. This is the \"Me\" of a man."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3064","context":"But we have proceeded too hastily. The \"Me\" of many men may be said to"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3065","context":"consist largely of their consciousness of the body and their physical"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3066","context":"appetites, etc. Their consciousness being largely bound up with their"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3067","context":"bodily nature, they practically \"live there.\" Some men even go so far as"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3068","context":"to regard their personal apparel as a part of their \"Me\" and actually"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3069","context":"seem to consider it a part of themselves. A writer has humorously said"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3070","context":"that \"men consist of three parts--soul, body and clothes.\" These"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3071","context":"\"clothes conscious\" people would lose their personality if divested of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3072","context":"their clothing by savages upon the occasion of a shipwreck. But even"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3073","context":"many who are not so closely bound up with the idea of personal raiment"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3074","context":"stick closely to the consciousness of their bodies being their \"Me\" They"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3075","context":"cannot conceive of a Self independent of the body. Their mind seems to"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3076","context":"them to be practically \"a something belonging to\" their body-which in"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3077","context":"many cases it is indeed."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3079","context":"But as man rises in the scale of consciousness he is able to disentangle"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3080","context":"his \"Me\" from his idea of body, and is able to think of his body as"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3081","context":"\"belonging to\" the mental part of him. But even then he is very apt to"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3082","context":"identify the \"Me\" entirely with the mental states, feelings, etc., which"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3083","context":"he feels to exist within him. He is very apt to consider these internal"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3084","context":"states as identical with himself, instead of their being simply \"things\""}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3085","context":"produced by some part of his mentality, and existing within him--of him,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3086","context":"and in him, but still not \"himself.\" He sees that he may change these"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3087","context":"internal states of feelings by all effort of will, and that he may"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3088","context":"produce a feeling or state of an exactly opposite nature, in the same"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3089","context":"way, and yet the same \"Me\" exists. And so after a while he is able to"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3090","context":"set aside these various mental states, emotions, feelings, habits,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3091","context":"qualities, characteristics, and other personal mental belongings--he is"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3092","context":"able to set them aside in the \"not-me\" collection of curiosities and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3093","context":"encumbrances, as well as valuable possessions. This requires much mental"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3094","context":"concentration and power of mental analysis on the part of the student."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3095","context":"But still the task is possible for the advanced student, and even those"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3096","context":"not so far advanced are able to see, in the imagination, how the process"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3097","context":"may be performed."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3099","context":"After this laying-aside process has been performed, the student will"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3100","context":"find himself in conscious possession of a \"Self\" which may be considered"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3101","context":"in its \"I\" and \"Me\" dual aspects. The \"Me\" will be felt to be a"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3102","context":"Something mental in which thoughts, ideas, emotions, feelings, and other"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3103","context":"mental states may be produced. It may be considered as the \"mental"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3104","context":"womb,\" as the ancients styled it-capable of generating mental offspring."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3105","context":"It reports to the consciousness as a \"Me\" with latent powers of creation"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3106","context":"and generation of mental progeny of all sorts and kinds. Its powers of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3107","context":"creative energy are felt to be enormous. But still it seems to be"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3108","context":"conscious that it must receive some form of energy from either its \"I\""}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3109","context":"companion, or else from some other \"I\" ere it is able to bring into"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3110","context":"being its mental creations. This consciousness brings with it a"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3111","context":"realization of an enormous capacity for mental work and creative"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3114","context":"But the student soon finds that this is not all that he finds within his"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3115","context":"inner consciousness. He finds that there exists a mental Something which"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3116","context":"is able to Will that the \"Me\" act along certain creative lines, and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3117","context":"which is also able to stand aside and witness the mental creation. This"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3118","context":"part of himself he is taught to call his \"I.\" He is able to rest in its"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3119","context":"consciousness at will. He finds there not a consciousness of an ability"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3120","context":"to generate and actively create, in the sense of the gradual process"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3121","context":"attendant upon mental operations, but rather a sense and consciousness"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3122","context":"of an ability to project an energy from the \"I\" to the \"Me\"--a process"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3123","context":"of \"willing\" that the mental creation begin and proceed. He also finds"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3124","context":"that the \"I\" is able to stand aside and witness the operations of the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3125","context":"\"Me's\" mental creation and generation. There is this dual aspect in the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3126","context":"mind of every person. The \"I\" represents the Masculine Principle of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3127","context":"Mental Gender-the \"Me\" represents the Female Principle. The \"I\""}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3128","context":"represents the Aspect of Being; the \"Me\" the Aspect of Becoming. You"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3129","context":"will notice that the Principle of Correspondence operates on this plane"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3130","context":"just as it does upon the great plane upon which the creation of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3131","context":"Universes is performed. The two are similar in kind, although"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3132","context":"vastly different in degree. \"As above, so below; as below, so above.\""}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3134","context":"These aspects of mind-the Masculine and Feminine Principles-the \"I\" and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3135","context":"the \"Me\"-considered in connection with the well-known mental and psychic"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3136","context":"phenomena, give the master-key to these dimly known regions of mental"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3137","context":"operation and manifestation. The principle of Mental Gender gives the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3138","context":"truth underlying the whole field of the phenomena of mental influence,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3141","context":"The tendency of the Feminine Principle is always in the direction of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3142","context":"receiving impressions, while the tendency of the Masculine Principle is"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3143","context":"always in the direction of giving, out or expressing. The Feminine"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3144","context":"Principle has much more varied field of operation than has the Masculine"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3145","context":"Principle. The Feminine Principle conducts the work of generating new"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3146","context":"thoughts, concepts, ideas, including the work of the imagination. The"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3147","context":"Masculine Principle contents itself with the work of the \"Will\" in its"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3148","context":"varied phases. And yet, without the active aid of the Will of the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3149","context":"Masculine Principle, the Feminine Principle is apt to rest content with"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3150","context":"generating mental images which are the result of impressions received"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3151","context":"from outside, instead of producing original mental creations."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3153","context":"Persons who can give continued attention and thought to a subject"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3154","context":"actively employ both of the Mental Principles-the Feminine in the work"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3155","context":"of the mental generation, and the Masculine Will in stimulating and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3156","context":"energizing the creative portion of the mind. The majority of persons"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3157","context":"really employ the Masculine Principle but little, and are content to"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3158","context":"live according to the thoughts and ideas instilled into the \"Me\" from"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3159","context":"the \"I\" of other minds. But it is not our purpose to dwell upon this"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3160","context":"phase of the subject, which may be studied from any good text-book upon"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3161","context":"psychology, with the key that we have given you regarding Mental Gender."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3163","context":"The student of Psychic Phenomena is aware of the wonderful phenomena"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3164","context":"classified under the head of Telepathy; Thought Transference; Mental"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3165","context":"Influence; Suggestion; Hypnotism, etc. Many have sought for an"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3166","context":"explanation of these varied phases of phenomena under the theories of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3167","context":"the various \"dual mind\" teachers. And in a measure they are right, for"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3168","context":"there is clearly a manifestation of two distinct phases of mental"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3169","context":"activity. But if such students will consider these \"dual minds\" in the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3170","context":"light of the Hermetic Teachings regarding Vibrations and Mental Gender,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3171","context":"they will see that the long sought for key is at hand."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3173","context":"In the phenomena of Telepathy it is seen how the Vibratory Energy of the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3174","context":"Masculine Principle is projected toward the Feminine Principle of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3175","context":"another person, and the latter takes the seed-thought and allows it to"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3176","context":"develop into maturity. In the same way Suggestion and Hypnotism"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3177","context":"operates. The Masculine Principle of the person giving the suggestions"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3178","context":"directs a stream of Vibratory Energy or Will-Power toward the Feminine"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3179","context":"Principle of the other person, and the latter accepting it makes it its"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3180","context":"own and acts and thinks accordingly. An idea thus lodged in the mind of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3181","context":"another person grows and develops, and in time is regarded as the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3182","context":"rightful mental offspring of the individual, whereas it is in reality"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3183","context":"like the cuckoo egg placed in the sparrows nest, where it destroys the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3184","context":"rightful offspring and makes itself at home. The normal method is for"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3185","context":"the Masculine and Feminine Principles in a person's mind to co-ordinate"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3186","context":"and act harmoniously in conjunction with each other, but, unfortunately,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3187","context":"the Masculine Principle in the average person is too lazy to act-the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3188","context":"display of Will-Power is too slight-and the consequence is that such"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3189","context":"persons are ruled almost entirely by the minds and wills of other"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3190","context":"persons, whom they allow to do their thinking and willing for them."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3191","context":"How few original thoughts or original actions are performed by the"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3192","context":"average person? Are not the majority of persons mere shadows and echoes"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3193","context":"of others having stronger wills or minds than themselves? The trouble is"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3194","context":"that the average person dwells almost altogether in his \"Me\""}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3195","context":"consciousness and does not realize that he has such a thing as an \"I.\""}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3196","context":"He is polarized in his Feminine Principle of Mind, and the Masculine"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3197","context":"Principle, in which is lodged the Will, is allowed to remain inactive"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3198","context":"and not employed."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3200","context":"The strong men and women of the world invariably manifest the Masculine"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3201","context":"Principle of Will, and their strength depends materially upon this fact."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3202","context":"Instead of living upon the impressions made upon their minds by others,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3203","context":"they dominate their own minds by their Will, obtaining the kind of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3204","context":"mental images desired, and moreover dominate the minds of others"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3205","context":"likewise, in the same manner. Look at the strong people, how they manage"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3206","context":"to implant their seed-thoughts in the minds of the masses of the people,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3207","context":"thus causing the latter to think thoughts in accordance with the desires"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3208","context":"and wills of the strong individuals. This is why the masses of people"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3209","context":"are such sheeplike creatures, never originating an idea of their own,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3210","context":"nor using their own powers of mental activity."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3212","context":"The manifestation of Mental Gender may be noticed all around us in"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3213","context":"everyday life. The magnetic persons are those who are able to use the"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_3215","context":"The actor who makes people weep or cry as he wills, is employing this"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3216","context":"principle. And so is the successful orator, statesman, preacher, writer"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3217","context":"or other people who are before the public attention. The peculiar"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3218","context":"influence exerted by some people over others is due to the manifestation"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3219","context":"of Mental Gender, along the Vibrational lines above indicated. In this"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3220","context":"principle lies the secret of personal magnetism, personal influence,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3221","context":"fascination, etc., as well as the phenomena generally grouped under the"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_3224","context":"The student who has familiarized himself with the phenomena generally"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3225","context":"spoken of as \"psychic\" will have discovered the important part played in"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3226","context":"the said phenomena by that force which science has styled \"Suggestion,\""}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3227","context":"by which term is meant the process or method whereby an idea is"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_3232","context":"knowledge of Vibration and Mental Gender necessary for the student of"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_3236","context":"It is customary for the writers and teachers of Suggestion to explain"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3237","context":"that it is the \"objective or voluntary\" mind which make the mental"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_3239","context":"But they do not describe the process or give us any analogy in nature"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3240","context":"whereby we may more readily comprehend the idea. But if you will think"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3241","context":"of the matter in the light of the Hermetic Teachings you will be able to"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3242","context":"see that the energizing of the Feminine Principle by the Vibratory"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3243","context":"Energy of the Masculine Principle Is in accordance to the universal laws"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3244","context":"of nature, and that the natural world affords countless analogies"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3245","context":"whereby the principle may be understood. In fact, the Hermetic Teachings"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3246","context":"show that the very creation of the Universe follows the same law, and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3247","context":"that in all creative manifestations, upon the planes of the spiritual,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3248","context":"the mental, and the physical, there is always in operation this"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3249","context":"principle of Gender-this manifestation of the Masculine and the Feminine"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_3257","context":"We shall not enter into an extended discussion of, or description of,"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_3388","context":"individuals who have attained any degree of self-mastery, whether"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_3423","context":"about on the chess-board of life like mere pawns. By rising above these"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3424","context":"influencing causes, the advanced Hermetists seek a higher plane of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3425","context":"mental action, and by dominating their moods, emotions, impulses and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3426","context":"feelings, they create for themselves new characters, qualities and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3427","context":"powers, by which they overcome their ordinary environment, and thus"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3428","context":"become practically players instead of mere Pawns. Such people help to"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3429","context":"play the game of life understandingly, instead of being moved about this"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3430","context":"way and that way by stronger influences and powers and wills. They use"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3431","context":"the Principle of Cause and Effect, instead of being used by"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3432","context":"it. Of course, even the highest are subject to the Principle as it"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3433","context":"manifests on the higher planes, but on the lower planes of activity,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3434","context":"they are Masters instead of Slaves. As The Kybalion says:"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3436","context":"    \"The wise ones serve on the higher, but rule on the lower."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3437","context":"    They obey the laws coming from above them, But on their"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3438","context":"    own plane, and those below them they rule and give orders."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3439","context":"    And, yet, in so doing, they form a part of the Principle,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3440","context":"    instead of opposing it. The wise man falls in with the Law,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3441","context":"    and by understanding its movements he operates it instead"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3442","context":"    of being its blind slave. Just as does the skilled swimmer"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3443","context":"    turn this way and that way, going and coming as he will,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3444","context":"    instead of being as the log which is carried here and"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3445","context":"    there--so is the wise man as compared to the ordinary"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3446","context":"    man--and yet both swimmer and log; wise man and fool,"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3447","context":"    are subject to Law. He who understands this is well on"}

{"symbol":"five_rings_3452","context":"    \"True Hermetic Transmutation is a Mental Art.\"--The Kybalion."}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3454","context":"In the above axiom, the Hermetists teach that the great work of"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3455","context":"influencing one's environment is accomplished by Mental Power. The"}
{"symbol":"five_rings_3456","context":"Universe being wholly mental, it follows that it may be ruled only by"}
